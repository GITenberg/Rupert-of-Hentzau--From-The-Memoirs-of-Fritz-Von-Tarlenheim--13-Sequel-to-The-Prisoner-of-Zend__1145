    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE QUEEN&rsquo;S GOOD-BY
    </h2>
    <p>
      A man who has lived in the world, marking how every act, although in
      itself perhaps light and insignificant, may become the source of
      consequences that spread far and wide, and flow for years or centuries,
      could scarcely feel secure in reckoning that with the death of the Duke of
      Strelsau and the restoration of King Rudolf to liberty and his throne,
      there would end, for good and all, the troubles born of Black Michael&rsquo;s
      daring conspiracy. The stakes had been high, the struggle keen; the edge
      of passion had been sharpened, and the seeds of enmity sown. Yet Michael,
      having struck for the crown, had paid for the blow with his life: should
      there not then be an end? Michael was dead, the Princess her cousin&rsquo;s
      wife, the story in safe keeping, and Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s face seen no more in
      Ruritania. Should there not then be an end? So said I to my friend the
      Constable of Zenda, as we talked by the bedside of Marshal Strakencz. The
      old man, already nearing the death that soon after robbed us of his aid
      and counsel, bowed his head in assent: in the aged and ailing the love of
      peace breeds hope of it. But Colonel Sapt tugged at his gray moustache,
      and twisted his black cigar in his mouth, saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very sanguine,
      friend Fritz. But is Rupert of Hentzau dead? I had not heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well said, and like old Sapt! Yet the man is little without the
      opportunity, and Rupert by himself could hardly have troubled our repose.
      Hampered by his own guilt, he dared not set his foot in the kingdom from
      which by rare good luck he had escaped, but wandered to and fro over
      Europe, making a living by his wits, and, as some said, adding to his
      resources by gallantries for which he did not refuse substantial
      recompense. But he kept himself constantly before our eyes, and never
      ceased to contrive how he might gain permission to return and enjoy the
      estates to which his uncle&rsquo;s death had entitled him. The chief agent
      through whom he had the effrontery to approach the king was his relative,
      the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim, a young man of high rank and great wealth
      who was devoted to Rupert. The count fulfilled his mission well:
      acknowledging Rupert&rsquo;s heavy offences, he put forward in his behalf the
      pleas of youth and of the predominant influence which Duke Michael had
      exercised over his adherent, and promised, in words so significant as to
      betray Rupert&rsquo;s own dictation, a future fidelity no less discreet than
      hearty. &ldquo;Give me my price and I&rsquo;ll hold my tongue,&rdquo; seemed to come in
      Rupert&rsquo;s off-hand accents through his cousin&rsquo;s deferential lips. As may be
      supposed, however, the king and those who advised him in the matter,
      knowing too well the manner of man the Count of Hentzau was, were not
      inclined to give ear to his ambassador&rsquo;s prayer. We kept firm hold on
      Master Rupert&rsquo;s revenues, and as good watch as we could on his movements;
      for we were most firmly determined that he should never return to
      Ruritania. Perhaps we might have obtained his extradition and hanged him
      on the score of his crimes; but in these days every rogue who deserves no
      better than to be strung up to the nearest tree must have what they call a
      fair trial; and we feared that, if Rupert were handed over to our police
      and arraigned before the courts at Strelsau, the secret which we guarded
      so sedulously would become the gossip of all the city, ay, and of all
      Europe. So Rupert went unpunished except by banishment and the impounding
      of his rents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Sapt was in the right about him. Helpless as he seemed, he did not for
      an instant abandon the contest. He lived in the faith that his chance
      would come, and from day to day was ready for its coming. He schemed
      against us as we schemed to protect ourselves from him; if we watched him,
      he kept his eye on us. His ascendency over Luzau-Rischenheim grew markedly
      greater after a visit which his cousin paid to him in Paris. From this
      time the young count began to supply him with resources. Thus armed, he
      gathered instruments round him and organized a system of espionage that
      carried to his ears all our actions and the whole position of affairs at
      court. He knew, far more accurately than anyone else outside the royal
      circle, the measures taken for the government of the kingdom and the
      considerations that dictated the royal policy. More than this, he
      possessed himself of every detail concerning the king&rsquo;s health, although
      the utmost reticence was observed on this subject. Had his discoveries
      stopped there, they would have been vexatious and disquieting, but perhaps
      of little serious harm. They went further. Set on the track by his
      acquaintance with what had passed during Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s tenure of the
      throne, he penetrated the secret which had been kept successfully from the
      king himself. In the knowledge of it he found the opportunity for which he
      had waited; in its bold use he discerned his chance. I cannot say whether
      he were influenced more strongly by his desire to reestablish his position
      in the kingdom or by the grudge he bore against Mr. Rassendyll. He loved
      power and money; dearly he loved revenge also. No doubt both motives
      worked together, and he was rejoiced to find that the weapon put into his
      hand had a double edge; with one he hoped to cut his own path clear; with
      the other, to wound the man he hated through the woman whom that man
      loved. In fine, the Count of Hentzau, shrewdly discerning the feeling that
      existed between the queen and Rudolf Rassendyll, set his spies to work,
      and was rewarded by discovering the object of my yearly meetings with Mr.
      Rassendyll. At least he conjectured the nature of my errand; this was
      enough for him. Head and hand were soon busy in turning the knowledge to
      account; scruples of the heart never stood in Rupert&rsquo;s way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage which had set all Ruritania on fire with joy and formed in
      the people&rsquo;s eyes the visible triumph over Black Michael and his
      fellow-conspirators was now three years old. For three years the Princess
      Flavia had been queen. I am come by now to the age when a man should look
      out on life with an eye undimmed by the mists of passion. My love-making
      days are over; yet there is nothing for which I am more thankful to
      Almighty God than the gift of my wife&rsquo;s love. In storm it has been my
      anchor, and in clear skies my star. But we common folk are free to follow
      our hearts; am I an old fool for saying that he is a fool who follows
      anything else? Our liberty is not for princes. We need wait for no future
      world to balance the luck of men; even here there is an equipoise. From
      the highly placed a price is exacted for their state, their wealth, and
      their honors, as heavy as these are great; to the poor, what is to us mean
      and of no sweetness may appear decked in the robes of pleasure and
      delight. Well, if it were not so, who could sleep at nights? The burden
      laid on Queen Flavia I knew, and know, so well as a man can know it. I
      think it needs a woman to know it fully; for even now my wife&rsquo;s eyes fill
      with tears when we speak of it. Yet she bore it, and if she failed in
      anything, I wonder that it was in so little. For it was not only that she
      had never loved the king and had loved another with all her heart. The
      king&rsquo;s health, shattered by the horror and rigors of his imprisonment in
      the castle of Zenda, soon broke utterly. He lived, indeed; nay, he shot
      and hunted, and kept in his hand some measure, at least, of government.
      But always from the day of his release he was a fretful invalid, different
      utterly from the gay and jovial prince whom Michael&rsquo;s villains had caught
      in the shooting lodge. There was worse than this. As time went on, the
      first impulse of gratitude and admiration that he had felt towards Mr.
      Rassendyll died away. He came to brood more and more on what had passed
      while he was a prisoner; he was possessed not only by a haunting dread of
      Rupert of Hentzau, at whose hands he had suffered so greatly, but also by
      a morbid, half mad jealousy of Mr. Rassendyll. Rudolf had played the hero
      while he lay helpless. Rudolf&rsquo;s were the exploits for which his own people
      cheered him in his own capital. Rudolf&rsquo;s were the laurels that crowned his
      impatient brow. He had enough nobility to resent his borrowed credit,
      without the fortitude to endure it manfully. And the hateful comparison
      struck him nearer home. Sapt would tell him bluntly that Rudolf did this
      or that, set this precedent or that, laid down this or the other policy,
      and that the king could do no better than follow in Rudolf&rsquo;s steps. Mr.
      Rassendyll&rsquo;s name seldom passed his wife&rsquo;s lips, but when she spoke of him
      it was as one speaks of a great man who is dead, belittling all the living
      by the shadow of his name. I do not believe that the king discerned that
      truth which his wife spent her days in hiding from him; yet he was uneasy
      if Rudolf&rsquo;s name were mentioned by Sapt or myself, and from the queen&rsquo;s
      mouth he could not bear it. I have seen him fall into fits of passion on
      the mere sound of it; for he lost control of himself on what seemed slight
      provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved by this disquieting jealousy, he sought continually to exact from
      the queen proofs of love and care beyond what most husbands can boast of,
      or, in my humble judgment, make good their right to, always asking of her
      what in his heart he feared was not hers to give. Much she did in pity and
      in duty; but in some moments, being but human and herself a woman of high
      temper, she failed; then the slight rebuff or involuntary coldness was
      magnified by a sick man&rsquo;s fancy into great offence or studied insult, and
      nothing that she could do would atone for it. Thus they, who had never in
      truth come together, drifted yet further apart; he was alone in his
      sickness and suspicion, she in her sorrows and her memories. There was no
      child to bridge the gulf between them, and although she was his queen and
      his wife, she grew almost a stranger to him. So he seemed to will that it
      should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, worse than widowed, she lived for three years; and once only in each
      year she sent three words to the man she loved, and received from him
      three words in answer. Then her strength failed her. A pitiful scene had
      occurred in which the king peevishly upbraided her in regard to some
      trivial matter&mdash;the occasion escapes my memory&mdash;speaking to her
      before others words that even alone she could not have listened to with
      dignity. I was there, and Sapt; the colonel&rsquo;s small eyes had gleamed in
      anger. &ldquo;I should like to shut his mouth for him,&rdquo; I heard him mutter, for
      the king&rsquo;s waywardness had well-nigh worn out even his devotion. The
      thing, of which I will say no more, happened a day or two before I was to
      set out to meet Mr. Rassendyll. I was to seek him this time at Wintenberg,
      for I had been recognized the year before at Dresden; and Wintenberg,
      being a smaller place and less in the way of chance visitors, was deemed
      safer. I remember well how she was when she called me into her own room, a
      few hours after she had left the king. She stood by the table; the box was
      on it, and I knew well that the red rose and the message were within. But
      there was more to-day. Without preface she broke into the subject of my
      errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must write to him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it, I must write. My dear
      friend Fritz, you will carry it safely for me, won&rsquo;t you? And he must
      write to me. And you&rsquo;ll bring that safely, won&rsquo;t you? Ah, Fritz, I know
      I&rsquo;m wrong, but I&rsquo;m starved, starved, starved! And it&rsquo;s for the last time.
      For I know now that if I send anything, I must send more. So after this
      time I won&rsquo;t send at all. But I must say good-by to him; I must have his
      good-by to carry me through my life. This once, then, Fritz, do it for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears rolled down her cheeks, which to-day were flushed out of their
      paleness to a stormy red; her eyes defied me even while they pleaded. I
      bent my head and kissed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With God&rsquo;s help I&rsquo;ll carry it safely and bring his safely, my queen,&rdquo;
       said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tell me how he looks. Look at him closely, Fritz. See if he is well
      and seems strong. Oh, and make him merry and happy! Bring that smile to
      his lips, Fritz, and the merry twinkle to his eyes. When you speak of me,
      see if he&mdash;if he looks as if he still loved me.&rdquo; But then she broke
      off, crying, &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t tell him I said that. He&rsquo;d be grieved if I doubted
      his love. I don&rsquo;t doubt it; I don&rsquo;t, indeed; but still tell me how he
      looks when you speak of me, won&rsquo;t you, Fritz? See, here&rsquo;s the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking it from her bosom, she kissed it before she gave it to me. Then she
      added a thousand cautions, how I was to carry her letter, how I was to go
      and how return, and how I was to run no danger, because my wife Helga
      loved me as well as she would have loved her husband had Heaven been
      kinder. &ldquo;At least, almost as I should, Fritz,&rdquo; she said, now between
      smiles and tears. She would not believe that any woman could love as she
      loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left the queen and went to prepare for my journey. I used to take only
      one servant with me, and I had chosen a different man each year. None of
      them had known that I met Mr. Rassendyll, but supposed that I was engaged
      on the private business which I made my pretext for obtaining leave of
      absence from the king. This time I had determined to take with me a Swiss
      youth who had entered my service only a few weeks before. His name was
      Bauer; he seemed a stolid, somewhat stupid fellow, but as honest as the
      day and very obliging.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come to me well recommended, and I had not hesitated to engage him.
      I chose him for my companion now, chiefly because he was a foreigner and
      therefore less likely to gossip with the other servants when we returned.
      I do not pretend to much cleverness, but I confess that it vexes me to
      remember how that stout, guileless-looking youth made a fool of me. For
      Rupert knew that I had met Mr. Rassendyll the year before at Dresden;
      Rupert was keeping a watchful eye on all that passed in Strelsau; Rupert
      had procured the fellow his fine testimonials and sent him to me, in the
      hope that he would chance on something of advantage to his employer. My
      resolve to take him to Wintenberg may have been hoped for, but could
      scarcely have been counted on; it was the added luck that waits so often
      on the plans of a clever schemer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going to take leave of the king, I found him huddled over the fire. The
      day was not cold, but the damp chill of his dungeon seemed to have
      penetrated to the very core of his bones. He was annoyed at my going, and
      questioned me peevishly about the business that occasioned my journey. I
      parried his curiosity as I best could, but did not succeed in appeasing
      his ill-humor. Half ashamed of his recent outburst, half-anxious to
      justify it to himself, he cried fretfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business! Yes, any business is a good enough excuse for leaving me! By
      Heaven, I wonder if a king was ever served so badly as I am! Why did you
      trouble to get me out of Zenda? Nobody wants me, nobody cares whether I
      live or die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To reason with such a mood was impossible. I could only assure him that I
      would hasten my return by all possible means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, pray do,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I want somebody to look after me. Who knows what
      that villain Rupert may attempt against me? And I can&rsquo;t defend myself can
      I? I&rsquo;m not Rudolf Rassendyll, am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, with a mixture of plaintiveness and malice, he scolded me. At last I
      stood silent, waiting till he should be pleased to dismiss me. At any rate
      I was thankful that he entertained no suspicion as to my errand. Had I
      spoken a word of Mr. Rassendyll he would not have let me go. He had fallen
      foul of me before on learning that I was in communication with Rudolf; so
      completely had jealousy destroyed gratitude in his breast. If he had known
      what I carried, I do not think that he could have hated his preserver
      more. Very likely some such feeling was natural enough; it was none the
      less painful to perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the king&rsquo;s presence, I sought out the Constable of Zenda. He
      knew my errand; and, sitting down beside him, I told him of the letter I
      carried, and arranged how to apprise him of my fortune surely and quickly.
      He was not in a good humor that day: the king had ruffled him also, and
      Colonel Sapt had no great reserve of patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we haven&rsquo;t cut one another&rsquo;s throats before then, we shall all be at
      Zenda by the time you arrive at Wintenberg,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The court moves
      there to-morrow, and I shall be there as long as the king is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and then added: &ldquo;Destroy the letter if there&rsquo;s any danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And destroy yourself with it, if there&rsquo;s the only way,&rdquo; he went on with a
      surly smile. &ldquo;Heaven knows why she must send such a silly message at all;
      but since she must, she&rsquo;d better have sent me with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew that Sapt was in the way of jeering at all sentiment, and I took no
      notice of the terms that he applied to the queen&rsquo;s farewell. I contented
      myself with answering the last part of what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s better you should be here,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;For if I should lose the
      letter&mdash;though there&rsquo;s little chance of it&mdash;you could prevent it
      from coming to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could try,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;But on my life, to run the chance for a
      letter&rsquo;s sake! A letter&rsquo;s a poor thing to risk the peace of a kingdom
      for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappily,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the only thing that a messenger can well
      carry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off with you, then,&rdquo; grumbled the colonel. &ldquo;Tell Rassendyll from me that
      he did well. But tell him to do something more. Let &lsquo;em say good-by and
      have done with it. Good God, is he going to waste all his life thinking of
      a woman he never sees?&rdquo; Sapt&rsquo;s air was full of indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more is he to do?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t his work here done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s done. Perhaps it&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;At least he has given us
      back our good king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To lay on the king the full blame for what he was would have been rank
      injustice. Sapt was not guilty of it, but his disappointment was bitter
      that all our efforts had secured no better ruler for Ruritania. Sapt could
      serve, but he liked his master to be a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I&rsquo;m afraid the lad&rsquo;s work here is done,&rdquo; he said, as I shook him by
      the hand. Then a sudden light came in his eyes. &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man need not, I hope, be deemed uxorious for liking a quiet dinner alone
      with his wife before he starts on a long journey. Such, at least, was my
      fancy; and I was annoyed to find that Helga&rsquo;s cousin, Anton von Strofzin,
      had invited himself to share our meal and our farewell. He conversed with
      his usual airy emptiness on all the topics that were supplying Strelsau
      with gossip. There were rumors that the king was ill; that the queen was
      angry at being carried off to Zenda; that the archbishop meant to preach
      against low dresses; that the chancellor was to be dismissed; that his
      daughter was to be married; and so forth. I heard without listening. But
      the last bit of his budget caught my wandering attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were betting at the club,&rdquo; said Anton, &ldquo;that Rupert of Hentzau would
      be recalled. Have you heard anything about it, Fritz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If I had known anything, it is needless to say that I should not have
      confided it to Anton. But the suggested step was so utterly at variance
      with the king&rsquo;s intentions that I made no difficulty about contradicting
      the report with an authoritative air. Anton heard me with a judicial
      wrinkle on his smooth brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I dare say you&rsquo;re bound to say so.
      All I know is that Rischenheim dropped a hint to Colonel Markel a day or
      two ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rischenheim believes what he hopes,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where&rsquo;s he gone?&rdquo; cried Anton, exultantly. &ldquo;Why has he suddenly left
      Strelsau? I tell you he&rsquo;s gone to meet Rupert, and I&rsquo;ll bet you what you
      like he carries some proposal. Ah, you don&rsquo;t know everything, Fritz, my
      boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed true that I did not know everything. I made haste to admit
      as much. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even know that the count was gone, much less why he&rsquo;s
      gone,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see?&rdquo; exclaimed Anton. And he added, patronizingly, &ldquo;You should keep
      your ears open, my boy; then you might be worth what the king pays you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No less, I trust,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for he pays me nothing.&rdquo; Indeed, at this time
      I held no office save the honorary position of chamberlain to Her Majesty.
      Any advice the king needed from me was asked and given unofficially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anton went off, persuaded that he had scored a point against me. I could
      not see where. It was possible that the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim had
      gone to meet his cousin, equally possible that no such business claimed
      his care. At any rate, the matter was not for me. I had a more pressing
      affair in hand. Dismissing the whole thing from my mind, I bade the butler
      tell Bauer to go forward with my luggage and to let my carriage be at the
      door in good time. Helga had busied herself, since our guest&rsquo;s departure,
      in preparing small comforts for my journey; now she came to me to say
      good-by. Although she tried to hide all signs of it, I detected an
      uneasiness in her manner. She did not like these errands of mine,
      imagining dangers and risks of which I saw no likelihood. I would not give
      in to her mood, and, as I kissed her, I bade her expect me back in a few
      days&rsquo; time. Not even to her did I speak of the new and more dangerous
      burden that I carried, although I was aware that she enjoyed a full
      measure of the queen&rsquo;s confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love to King Rudolf, the real King Rudolf,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Though you
      carry what will make him think little of my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no desire he should think too much of it, sweet,&rdquo; said I. She
      caught me by the hands, and looked up in my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a friend you are, aren&rsquo;t you, Fritz?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You worship Mr.
      Rassendyll. I know you think I should worship him too, if he asked me.
      Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t. I am foolish enough to have my own idol.&rdquo; All my
      modesty did not let me doubt who her idol might be. Suddenly she drew near
      to me and whispered in my ear. I think that our own happiness brought to
      her a sudden keen sympathy with her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make him send her a loving message, Fritz,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Something
      that will comfort her. Her idol can&rsquo;t be with her as mine is with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;ll send something to comfort her,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And God keep you,
      my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For he would surely send an answer to the letter that I carried, and that
      answer I was sworn to bring safely to her. So I set out in good heart,
      bearing in the pocket of my coat the little box and the queen&rsquo;s good-by.
      And, as Colonel Sapt said to me, both I would destroy, if need were&mdash;ay,
      and myself with them. A man did not serve Queen Flavia with divided mind.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. A STATION WITHOUT A CAB
    </h2>
    <p>
      The arrangements for my meeting with Mr. Rassendyll had been carefully
      made by correspondence before he left England. He was to be at the Golden
      Lion Hotel at eleven o&rsquo;clock on the night of the 15th of October. I
      reckoned to arrive in the town between eight and nine on the same evening,
      to proceed to another hotel, and, on pretence of taking a stroll, slip out
      and call on him at the appointed hour. I should then fulfil my commission,
      take his answer, and enjoy the rare pleasure of a long talk with him.
      Early the next morning he would have left Wintenberg, and I should be on
      my way back to Strelsau. I knew that he would not fail to keep his
      appointment, and I was perfectly confident of being able to carry out the
      programme punctually; I had, however, taken the precaution of obtaining a
      week&rsquo;s leave of absence, in case any unforeseen accident should delay my
      return. Conscious of having done all I could to guard against
      misunderstanding or mishap, I got into the train in a tolerably peaceful
      frame of mind. The box was in my inner pocket, the letter in a
      portemonnaie. I could feel them both with my hand. I was not in uniform,
      but I took my revolver. Although I had no reason to anticipate any
      difficulties, I did not forget that what I carried must be protected at
      all hazards and all costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weary night journey wore itself away. Bauer came to me in the morning,
      performed his small services, repacked my hand-bag, procured me some
      coffee, and left me. It was then about eight o&rsquo;clock; we had arrived at a
      station of some importance and were not to stop again till mid-day. I saw
      Bauer enter the second-class compartment in which he was traveling, and
      settled down in my own coupe. I think it was at this moment that the
      thought of Rischenheim came again into my head, and I found myself
      wondering why he clung to the hopeless idea of compassing Rupert&rsquo;s return
      and what business had taken him from Strelsau. But I made little of the
      matter, and, drowsy from a broken night&rsquo;s rest, soon fell into a doze. I
      was alone in the carriage and could sleep without fear or danger. I was
      awakened by our noontide halt. Here I saw Bauer again. After taking a
      basin of soup, I went to the telegraph bureau to send a message to my
      wife; the receipt of it would not merely set her mind at ease, but would
      also ensure word of my safe progress reaching the queen. As I entered the
      bureau I met Bauer coming out of it. He seemed rather startled at our
      encounter, but told me readily enough that he had been telegraphing for
      rooms at Wintenberg, a very needless precaution, since there was no danger
      of the hotel being full. In fact I was annoyed, as I especially wished to
      avoid calling attention to my arrival. However, the mischief was done, and
      to rebuke my servant might have aggravated it by setting his wits at work
      to find out my motive for secrecy. So I said nothing, but passed by him
      with a nod. When the whole circumstances came to light, I had reason to
      suppose that besides his message to the inn-keeper, Bauer sent one of a
      character and to a quarter unsuspected by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stopped once again before reaching Wintenberg. I put my head out of the
      window to look about me, and saw Bauer standing near the luggage van. He
      ran to me eagerly, asking whether I required anything. I told him
      &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;; but instead of going away, he began to talk to me. Growing
      weary of him, I returned to my seat and waited impatiently for the train
      to go on. There was a further delay of five minutes, and then we started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; I exclaimed, leaning back comfortably in my seat and
      taking a cigar from my case.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in a moment the cigar rolled unheeded on to the floor, as I sprang
      eagerly to my feet and darted to the window. For just as we were clearing
      the station, I saw being carried past the carriage, on the shoulders of a
      porter, a bag which looked very much like mine. Bauer had been in charge
      of my bag, and it had been put in the van under his directions. It seemed
      unlikely that it should be taken out now by any mistake. Yet the bag I saw
      was very like the bag I owned. But I was not sure, and could have done
      nothing had I been sure. We were not to stop again before Wintenberg, and,
      with my luggage or without it, I myself must be in the town that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived punctual to our appointed time. I sat in the carriage a moment
      or two, expecting Bauer to open the door and relieve me of my small
      baggage. He did not come, so I got out. It seemed that I had few
      fellow-passengers, and these were quickly disappearing on foot or in
      carriages and carts that waited outside the station. I stood looking for
      my servant and my luggage. The evening was mild; I was encumbered with my
      hand-bag and a heavy fur coat. There were no signs either of Bauer or of
      baggage. I stayed where I was for five or six minutes. The guard of the
      train had disappeared, but presently I observed the station-master; he
      seemed to be taking a last glance round the premises. Going up to him I
      asked whether he had seen my servant; he could give me no news of him. I
      had no luggage ticket, for mine had been in Bauer&rsquo;s hands; but I prevailed
      on him to allow me to look at the baggage which had arrived; my property
      was not among it. The station-master was inclined, I think, to be a little
      skeptical as to the existence both of bag and of servant. His only
      suggestion was that the man must have been left behind accidentally. I
      pointed out that in this case he would not have had the bag with him, but
      that it would have come on in the train. The station-master admitted the
      force of my argument; he shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands out;
      he was evidently at the end of his resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for the first time and with sudden force, a doubt of Bauer&rsquo;s fidelity
      thrust itself into my mind. I remembered how little I knew of the fellow
      and how great my charge was. Three rapid movements of my hand assured me
      that letter, box, and revolver were in their respective places. If Bauer
      had gone hunting in the bag, he had drawn a blank. The station-master
      noticed nothing; he was stating at the dim gas lamp that hung from the
      roof. I turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell him when he comes&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come to-night, now,&rdquo; interrupted the stationmaster, none too
      politely. &ldquo;No other train arrives to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him when he does come to follow me at once to the Wintenbergerhof.
      I&rsquo;m going there immediately.&rdquo; For time was short, and I did not wish to
      keep Mr. Rassendyll waiting. Besides, in my new-born nervousness, I was
      anxious to accomplish my errand as soon as might be. What had become of
      Bauer? The thought returned, and now with it another, that seemed to
      connect itself in some subtle way with my present position: why and
      whither had the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim set out from Strelsau a day
      before I started on my journey to Wintenberg?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he comes I&rsquo;ll tell him,&rdquo; said the station-master, and as he spoke he
      looked round the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a cab to be seen! I knew that the station lay on the extreme
      outskirts of the town, for I had passed through Wintenberg on my wedding
      journey, nearly three years before. The trouble involved in walking, and
      the further waste of time, put the cap on my irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have enough cabs?&rdquo; I asked angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are plenty generally, sir,&rdquo; he answered more civilly, with an
      apologetic air. &ldquo;There would be to-night but for an accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another accident! This expedition of mine seemed doomed to be the sport of
      chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just before your train arrived,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;a local came in. As a
      rule, hardly anybody comes by it, but to-night a number of men&mdash;oh,
      twenty or five-and-twenty, I should think&mdash;got out. I collected their
      tickets myself, and they all came from the first station on the line.
      Well, that&rsquo;s not so strange, for there&rsquo;s a good beer-garden there. But,
      curiously enough, every one of them hired a separate cab and drove off,
      laughing and shouting to one another as they went. That&rsquo;s how it happens
      that there were only one or two cabs left when your train came in, and
      they were snapped up at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taken alone, this occurrence was nothing; but I asked myself whether the
      conspiracy that had robbed me of my servant had deprived me of a vehicle
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of men were they?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All sorts of men, sir,&rdquo; answered the station-master, &ldquo;but most of them
      were shabby-looking fellows. I wondered where some of them had got the
      money for their ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vague feeling of uneasiness which had already attacked me grew
      stronger. Although I fought against it, calling myself an old woman and a
      coward, I must confess to an impulse which almost made me beg the
      station-master&rsquo;s company on my walk; but, besides being ashamed to exhibit
      a timidity apparently groundless, I was reluctant to draw attention to
      myself in any way. I would not for the world have it supposed that I
      carried anything of value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no help for it,&rdquo; said I, and, buttoning my heavy coat about
      me, I took my hand-bag and stick in one hand, and asked my way to the
      hotel. My misfortunes had broken down the station-master&rsquo;s indifference,
      and he directed me in a sympathetic tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight along the road, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;between the poplars, for hard on
      half a mile; then the houses begin, and your hotel is in the first square
      you come to, on the right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him curtly (for I had not quite forgiven him his earlier
      incivility), and started on my walk, weighed down by my big coat and the
      handbag. When I left the lighted station yard I realized that the evening
      had fallen very dark, and the shade of the tall lank trees intensified the
      gloom. I could hardly see my way, and went timidly, with frequent stumbles
      over the uneven stones of the road. The lamps were dim, few, and widely
      separated; so far as company was concerned, I might have been a thousand
      miles from an inhabited house. In spite of myself, the thought of danger
      persistently assailed my mind. I began to review every circumstance of my
      journey, twisting the trivial into some ominous shape, magnifying the
      significance of everything which might justly seem suspicious, studying in
      the light of my new apprehensions every expression of Bauer&rsquo;s face and
      every word that had fallen from his lips. I could not persuade myself into
      security. I carried the queen&rsquo;s letter, and&mdash;well, I would have given
      much to have old Sapt or Rudolf Rassendyll by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when a man suspects danger, let him not spend his time in asking
      whether there be really danger or in upbraiding himself for timidity, but
      let him face his cowardice, and act as though the danger were real. If I
      had followed that rule and kept my eyes about me, scanning the sides of
      the road and the ground in front of my feet, instead of losing myself in a
      maze of reflection, I might have had time to avoid the trap, or at least
      to get my hand to my revolver and make a fight for it; or, indeed, in the
      last resort, to destroy what I carried before harm came to it. But my mind
      was preoccupied, and the whole thing seemed to happen in a minute. At the
      very moment that I had declared to myself the vanity of my fears and
      determined to be resolute in banishing them, I heard voices&mdash;a low,
      strained whispering; I saw two or three figures in the shadow of the
      poplars by the wayside. An instant later, a dart was made at me. While I
      could fly I would not fight; with a sudden forward plunge I eluded the men
      who rushed at me, and started at a run towards the lights of the town and
      the shapes of the houses, now distant about a quarter of a mile. Perhaps I
      ran twenty yards, perhaps fifty; I do not know. I heard the steps behind
      me, quick as my own. Then I fell headlong on the road&mdash;tripped up! I
      understood. They had stretched a rope across my path; as I fell a man
      bounded up from either side, and I found the rope slack under my body.
      There I lay on my face; a man knelt on me, others held either hand; my
      face was pressed into the mud of the road, and I was like to have been
      stifled; my hand-bag had whizzed away from me. Then a voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn him over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew the voice; it was a confirmation of the fears which I had lately
      been at such pains to banish. It justified the forecast of Anton von
      Strofzin, and explained the wager of the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim&mdash;for
      it was Rischenheim&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They caught hold of me and began to turn me on my back. Here I saw a
      chance, and with a great heave of my body I flung them from me. For a
      short instant I was free; my impetuous attack seemed to have startled the
      enemy; I gathered myself up on my knees. But my advantage was not to last
      long. Another man, whom I had not seen, sprang suddenly on me like a
      bullet from a catapult. His fierce onset overthrew me; I was stretched on
      the ground again, on my back now, and my throat was clutched viciously in
      strong fingers. At the same moment my arms were again seized and pinned.
      The face of the man on my chest bent down towards mine, and through the
      darkness I discerned the features of Rupert of Hentzau. He was panting
      with the sudden exertion and the intense force with which he held me, but
      he was smiling also; and when he saw by my eyes that I knew him, he
      laughed softly in triumph. Then came Rischenheim&rsquo;s voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the bag he carried? It may be in the bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fool, he&rsquo;ll have it about him,&rdquo; said Rupert, scornfully. &ldquo;Hold him
      fast while I search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On either side my hands were still pinned fast. Rupert&rsquo;s left hand did not
      leave my throat, but his free right hand began to dart about me, feeling,
      probing, and rummaging. I lay quite helpless and in the bitterness of
      great consternation. Rupert found my revolver, drew it out with a gibe,
      and handed it to Rischenheim, who was now standing beside him. Then he
      felt the box, he drew it out, his eyes sparkled. He set his knee hard on
      my chest, so that I could scarcely breathe; then he ventured to loose my
      throat, and tore the box open eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring a light here,&rdquo; he cried. Another ruffian came with a dark-lantern,
      whose glow he turned on the box. Rupert opened it, and when he saw what
      was inside, he laughed again, and stowed it away in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, quick!&rdquo; urged Rischenheim. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got what we wanted, and somebody
      may come at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A brief hope comforted me. The loss of the box was a calamity, but I would
      pardon fortune if only the letter escaped capture. Rupert might have
      suspected that I carried some such token as the box, but he could not know
      of the letter. Would he listen to Rischenheim? No. The Count of Hentzau
      did things thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may as well overhaul him a bit more,&rdquo; said he, and resumed his search.
      My hope vanished, for now he was bound to come upon the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another instant brought him to it. He snatched the pocketbook, and,
      motioning impatiently to the man to hold the lantern nearer, he began to
      examine the contents. I remember well the look of his face as the fierce
      white light threw it up against the darkness in its clear pallor and
      high-bred comeliness, with its curling lips and scornful eyes. He had the
      letter now, and a gleam of joy danced in his eyes as he tore it open. A
      hasty glance showed him what his prize was; then, coolly and deliberately
      he settled himself to read, regarding neither Rischenheim&rsquo;s nervous hurry
      nor my desperate, angry glance that glared up at him. He read leisurely,
      as though he had been in an armchair in his own house; the lips smiled and
      curled as he read the last words that the queen had written to her lover.
      He had indeed come on more than he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim laid a hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, Rupert, quick,&rdquo; he urged again, in a voice full of agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone, man. I haven&rsquo;t read anything so amusing for a long while,&rdquo;
       answered Rupert. Then he burst into a laugh, crying, &ldquo;Look, look!&rdquo; and
      pointing to the foot of the last page of the letter. I was mad with anger;
      my fury gave me new strength. In his enjoyment of what he read Rupert had
      grown careless; his knee pressed more lightly on me, and as he showed
      Rischenheim the passage in the letter that caused him so much amusement he
      turned his head away for an instant. My chance had come. With a sudden
      movement I displaced him, and with a desperate wrench I freed my right
      hand. Darting it out, I snatched at the letter. Rupert, alarmed for his
      treasure, sprang back and off me. I also sprang up on my feet, hurling
      away the fellow who had gripped my other hand. For a moment I stood facing
      Rupert; then I darted on him. He was too quick for me; he dodged behind
      the man with the lantern and hurled the fellow forward against me. The
      lantern fell on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your stick!&rdquo; I heard Rupert say. &ldquo;Where is it? That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came Rischenheim&rsquo;s voice again, imploring and timid:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rupert, you promised not to kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The only answer was a short, fierce laugh. I hurled away the man who had
      been thrust into my arms and sprang forward. I saw Rupert of Hentzau; his
      hand was raised above his head and held a stout club. I do not know what
      followed; there came&mdash;all in a confused blur of instant sequence&mdash;an
      oath from Rupert, a rush from me, a scuffle, as though some one sought to
      hold him back; then he was on me; I felt a great thud on my forehead, and
      I felt nothing more. Again I was on my back, with a terrible pain in my
      head, and a dull, dreamy consciousness of a knot of men standing over me,
      talking eagerly to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not hear what they were saying; I had no great desire to hear. I
      fancied, somehow, that they were talking about me; they looked at me and
      moved their hands towards me now and again. I heard Rupert&rsquo;s laugh, and
      saw his club poised over me; then Rischenheim caught him by the wrist. I
      know now that Rischenheim was reminding his cousin that he had promised
      not to kill me, that Rupert&rsquo;s oath did not weigh a straw in the scales,
      but that he was held back only by a doubt whether I alive or my dead body
      would be more inconvenient to dispose of. Yet then I did not understand,
      but lay there listless. And presently the talking forms seemed to cease
      their talking; they grew blurred and dim, running into one another, and
      all mingling together to form one great shapeless creature that seemed to
      murmur and gibber over me, some such monster as a man sees in his dreams.
      I hated to see it, and closed my eyes; its murmurings and gibberings
      haunted my ears for awhile, making me restless and unhappy; then they died
      away. Their going made me happy; I sighed in contentment; and everything
      became as though it were not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I had one more vision, breaking suddenly across my unconsciousness. A
      bold, rich voice rang out, &ldquo;By God, I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried another. Then, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; There was a rush of feet,
      the cries of men who met in anger or excitement, the crack of a shot and
      of another quickly following, oaths, and scuffling. Then came the sound of
      feet flying. I could not make it out; I grew weary with the puzzle of it.
      Would they not be quiet? Quiet was what I wanted. At last they grew quiet;
      I closed my eyes again. The pain was less now; they were quiet; I could
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man looks back on the past, reviewing in his mind the chances
      Fortune has given and the calls she has made, he always torments himself
      by thinking that he could have done other and better than in fact he did.
      Even now I lie awake at night sometimes, making clever plans by which I
      could have thwarted Rupert&rsquo;s schemes. In these musings I am very acute;
      Anton von Strofzin&rsquo;s idle talk furnishes me with many a clue, and I draw
      inferences sure and swift as a detective in the story books. Bauer is my
      tool, I am not his. I lay Rischenheim by the heels, send Rupert howling
      off with a ball in his arm, and carry my precious burden in triumph to Mr.
      Rassendyll. By the time I have played the whole game I am indeed proud of
      myself. Yet in truth&mdash;in daylight truth&mdash;I fear that, unless
      Heaven sent me a fresh set of brains, I should be caught in much the same
      way again. Though not by that fellow Bauer, I swear! Well, there it was.
      They had made a fool of me. I lay on the road with a bloody head, and
      Rupert of Hentzau had the queen&rsquo;s letter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. AGAIN TO ZENDA
    </h2>
    <p>
      By Heaven&rsquo;s care, or&mdash;since a man may be over-apt to arrogate to
      himself great share of such attention&mdash;by good luck, I had not to
      trust for my life to the slender thread of an oath sworn by Rupert of
      Hentzau. The visions of my dazed brain were transmutations of reality; the
      scuffle, the rush, the retreat were not all dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an honest fellow now living in Wintenberg comfortably and at his
      ease by reason that his wagon chanced to come lumbering along with three
      or four stout lads in it at the moment when Rupert was meditating a second
      and murderous blow. Seeing the group of us, the good carrier and his lads
      leapt down and rushed on my assailants. One of the thieves, they said, was
      for fighting it out&mdash;I could guess who that was&mdash;and called on
      the rest to stand; but they, more prudent, laid hands on him, and, in
      spite of his oaths, hustled him off along the road towards the station.
      Open country lay there and the promise of safety. My new friends set off
      in pursuit; but a couple of revolver shots, heard by me, but not
      understood, awoke their caution. Good Samaritans, but not men of war, they
      returned to where I lay senseless on the ground, congratulating themselves
      and me that an enemy so well armed should run and not stand his ground.
      They forced a drink of rough wine down my throat, and in a minute or two I
      opened my eyes. They were for carrying me to a hospital; I would have none
      of it. As soon as things grew clear to me again and I knew where I was, I
      did nothing but repeat in urgent tones, &ldquo;The Golden Lion, The Golden Lion!
      Twenty crowns to carry me to the Golden Lion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that I knew my own business and where I wished to go, one
      picked up my hand-bag and the rest hoisted me into their wagon and set out
      for the hotel where Rudolf Rassendyll was. The one thought my broken head
      held was to get to him as soon as might be and tell him how I had been
      fool enough to let myself be robbed of the queen&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was there. He stood on the threshold of the inn, waiting for me, as it
      seemed, although it was not yet the hour of my appointment. As they drew
      me up to the door, I saw his tall, straight figure and his red hair by the
      light of the hall lamps. By Heaven, I felt as a lost child must on sight
      of his mother! I stretched out my hand to him, over the side of the wagon,
      murmuring, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started at the words, and sprang forward to me. Then he turned quickly
      to the carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman is my friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Give him to me. I&rsquo;ll speak to you
      later.&rdquo; He waited while I was lifted down from the wagon into the arms
      that he held ready for me, and himself carried me across the threshold. I
      was quite clear in the head by now and understood all that passed. There
      were one or two people in the hall, but Mr. Rassendyll took no heed of
      them. He bore me quickly upstairs and into his sitting-room. There he set
      me down in an arm-chair, and stood opposite to me. He was smiling, but
      anxiety was awake in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost it,&rdquo; I said again, looking up at him pitifully enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said he, nodding. &ldquo;Will you wait, or can you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but give me some brandy,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf gave me a little brandy mixed in a great deal of water, and then I
      made shift to tell him. Though faint, I was not confused, and I gave my
      story in brief, hurried, yet sufficient words. He made no sign till I
      mentioned the letter. Then his face changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter, too?&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a strange mixture of increased
      apprehension and unlooked-for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a letter, too; she wrote a letter, and I carried that as well as the
      box. I&rsquo;ve lost them both, Rudolf. God help me, I&rsquo;ve lost them both! Rupert
      has the letter too!&rdquo; I think I must have been weak and unmanned from the
      blow I had received, for my composure broke down here. Rudolf stepped up
      to me and wrung me by the hand. I mastered myself again and looked in his
      face as he stood in thought, his hand caressing the strong curve of his
      clean-shaven chin. Now that I was with him again it seemed as though I had
      never lost him; as though we were still together in Strelsau or at
      Tarlenheim, planning how to hoodwink Black Michael, send Rupert of Hentzau
      to his own place, and bring the king back to his throne. For Mr.
      Rassendyll, as he stood before me now, was changed in nothing since our
      last meeting, nor indeed since he reigned in Strelsau, save that a few
      flecks of gray spotted his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      My battered head ached most consumedly. Mr. Rassendyll rang the bell
      twice, and a short, thickset man of middle age appeared; he wore a suit of
      tweed, and had the air of smartness and respectability which marks English
      servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James,&rdquo; said Rudolf, &ldquo;this gentleman has hurt his head. Look after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      James went out. In a few minutes he was back, with water, basin, towels,
      and bandages. Bending over me, he began to wash and tend my wound very
      deftly. Rudolf was walking up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done the head, James?&rdquo; he asked, after a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the servant, gathering together his appliances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telegraph forms, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      James went out, and was back with the forms in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be ready when I ring,&rdquo; said Rudolf. And he added, turning to me, &ldquo;Any
      easier, Fritz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can listen to you now,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see their game,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;One or other of them, Rupert or this
      Rischenheim, will try to get to the king with the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sprang to my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I cried, and I reeled back into my chair, with a feeling
      as if a red-hot poker were being run through my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much you can do to stop &lsquo;em, old fellow,&rdquo; smiled Rudolf, pausing to press
      my hand as he went by. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t trust the post, you know. One will go.
      Now which?&rdquo; He stood facing me with a thoughtful frown on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not know, but I thought that Rischenheim would go. It was a great
      risk for Rupert to trust himself in the kingdom, and he knew that the king
      would not easily be persuaded to receive him, however startling might be
      the business he professed as his errand. On the other hand, nothing was
      known against Rischenheim, while his rank would secure, and indeed
      entitle, him to an early audience. Therefore I concluded that Rischenheim
      would go with the letter, or, if Rupert would not let that out of his
      possession, with the news of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a copy,&rdquo; suggested Rassendyll. &ldquo;Well, Rischenheim or Rupert will be on
      his way by to-morrow morning, or is on his way to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I tried to rise, for I was on fire to prevent the fatal consequences
      of my stupidity. Rudolf thrust me back in my chair, saying, &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo; Then
      he sat down at the table and took up the telegraph forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and Sapt arranged a cipher, I suppose?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You write the message, and I&rsquo;ll put it into the cipher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I&rsquo;ve written: &lsquo;Document lost. Let nobody see him if
      possible. Wire who asks.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t like to make it plainer: most ciphers
      can be read, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not ours,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but will that do?&rdquo; asked Rudolf, with an unconvinced smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think he&rsquo;ll understand it.&rdquo; And I wrote it again in the cipher; it
      was as much as I could do to hold the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell was rung again, and James appeared in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send this,&rdquo; said Rudolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The offices will be shut, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James, James!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir; but it may take an hour to get one open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you half an hour. Have you money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; added Rudolf, turning to me, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not recollect what I answered, for my faintness came upon me again,
      and I remember only that Rudolf himself helped me into his own bed. I
      slept, but I do not think he so much as lay down on the sofa; chancing to
      awake once or twice, I heard him pacing about. But towards morning I slept
      heavily, and I did not know what he was doing then. At eight o&rsquo;clock James
      entered and roused me. He said that a doctor was to be at the hotel in
      half an hour, but that Mr. Rassendyll would like to see me for a few
      minutes if I felt equal to business. I begged James to summon his master
      at once. Whether I were equal or unequal, the business had to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf came, calm and serene. Danger and the need for exertion acted on
      him like a draught of good wine on a seasoned drinker. He was not only
      himself, but more than himself: his excellences enhanced, the indolence
      that marred him in quiet hours sloughed off. But to-day there was
      something more; I can only describe it as a kind of radiance. I have seen
      it on the faces of young sparks when the lady they love comes through the
      ball-room door, and I have seen it glow more softly in a girl&rsquo;s eyes when
      some fellow who seemed to me nothing out of the ordinary asked her for a
      dance. That strange gleam was on Rudolf&rsquo;s face as he stood by my bedside.
      I dare say it used to be on mine when I went courting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fritz, old friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an answer from Sapt. I&rsquo;ll lay the
      telegraph offices were stirred in Zenda as well as James stirred them here
      in Wintenberg! And what do you think? Rischenheim asked for an audience
      before he left Strelsau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I raised myself on my elbow in the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;He left on Monday. To-day&rsquo;s Wednesday. The
      king has granted him an audience at four on Friday. Well, then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They counted on success,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;and Rischenheim takes the letter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A copy, if I know Rupert of Hentzau. Yes, it was well laid. I like the
      men taking all the cabs! How much ahead had they, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not know that, though I had no more doubt than he that Rupert&rsquo;s hand
      was in the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I am going to wire to Sapt to put Rischenheim off
      for twelve hours if he can; failing that, to get the king away from
      Zenda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Rischenheim must have his audience sooner or later,&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sooner or later&mdash;there&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s difference between them!&rdquo; cried
      Rudolf Rassendyll. He sat down on the bed by me, and went on in quick,
      decisive words: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t move for a day or two. Send my message to Sapt.
      Tell him to keep you informed of what happens. As soon as you can travel,
      go to Strelsau, and let Sapt know directly you arrive. We shall want your
      help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are you going to do?&rdquo; I cried, staring at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me for a moment, and his face was crossed by conflicting
      feelings. I saw resolve there, obstinacy, and the scorn of danger; fun,
      too, and merriment; and, lastly, the same radiance I spoke of. He had been
      smoking a cigarette; now he threw the end of it into the grate and rose
      from the bed where he had been sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Zenda,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Zenda!&rdquo; I cried, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rudolf. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going again to Zenda, Fritz, old fellow. By
      heaven, I knew it would come, and now it has come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to do what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall overtake Rischenheim or be hot on his heels. If he gets there
      first, Sapt will keep him waiting till I come; and if I come, he shall
      never see the king. Yes, if I come in time&mdash;&rdquo; He broke into a sudden
      laugh. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;have I lost my likeness? Can&rsquo;t I still play the
      king? Yes, if I come in time, Rischenheim shall have his audience of the
      king of Zenda, and the king will be very gracious to him, and the king
      will take his copy of the letter from him! Oh, Rischenheim shall have an
      audience of King Rudolf in the castle of Zenda, never fear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood, looking to see how I received his plan; but amazed at the
      boldness of it, I could only lie back and gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf&rsquo;s excitement left him as suddenly as it had come; he was again the
      cool, shrewd, nonchalant Englishman, as, lighting another cigarette, he
      proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, there are two of them, Rupert and Rischenheim. Now you can&rsquo;t
      move for a day or two, that&rsquo;s certain. But there must be two of us there
      in Ruritania. Rischenheim is to try first; but if he fails, Rupert will
      risk everything and break through to the king&rsquo;s presence. Give him five
      minutes with the king, and the mischief&rsquo;s done! Very well, then; Sapt must
      keep Rupert at bay while I tackle Rischenheim. As soon as you can move, go
      to Strelsau, and let Sapt know where you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re seen, if you&rsquo;re found out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better I than the queen&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo; said he. Then he laid his hand on my
      arm and said, quite quietly, &ldquo;If the letter gets to the king, I and I only
      can do what must be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not know what he meant; perhaps it was that he would carry off the
      queen sooner than leave her alone after her letter was known; but there
      was another possible meaning that I, a loyal subject, dared not inquire
      into. Yet I made no answer, for I was above all and first of all the
      queen&rsquo;s servant. Still I cannot believe that he meant harm to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Fritz,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look so glum. This is not so great an
      affair as the other, and we brought that through safe.&rdquo; I suppose I still
      looked doubtful, for he added, with a sort of impatience, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m
      going, anyhow. Heavens, man, am I to sit here while that letter is carried
      to the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I understood his feeling, and knew that he held life a light thing
      compared with the recovery of Queen Flavia&rsquo;s letter. I ceased to urge him.
      When I assented to his wishes, every shadow vanished from his face, and he
      began to discuss the details of the plan with business-like brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave James with you,&rdquo; said Rudolf. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be very useful, and
      you can rely on him absolutely. Any message that you dare trust to no
      other conveyance, give to him; he&rsquo;ll carry it. He can shoot, too.&rdquo; He rose
      as he spoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look in before I start,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and hear what the
      doctor says about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lay there, thinking, as men sick and weary in body will, of the dangers
      and the desperate nature of the risk, rather than of the hope which its
      boldness would have inspired in a healthy, active brain. I distrusted the
      rapid inference that Rudolf had drawn from Sapt&rsquo;s telegram, telling myself
      that it was based on too slender a foundation. Well, there I was wrong,
      and I am glad now to pay that tribute to his discernment. The first steps
      of Rupert&rsquo;s scheme were laid as Rudolf had conjectured: Rischenheim had
      started, even while I lay there, for Zenda, carrying on his person a copy
      of the queen&rsquo;s farewell letter and armed for his enterprise by his right
      of audience with the king. So far we were right, then; for the rest we
      were in darkness, not knowing or being able even to guess where Rupert
      would choose to await the result of the first cast, or what precautions he
      had taken against the failure of his envoy. But although in total
      obscurity as to his future plans, I traced his past actions, and
      subsequent knowledge has shown that I was right. Bauer was the tool; a
      couple of florins apiece had hired the fellows who, conceiving that they
      were playing a part in some practical joke, had taken all the cabs at the
      station. Rupert had reckoned that I should linger looking for my servant
      and luggage, and thus miss my last chance of a vehicle. If, however, I had
      obtained one, the attack would still have been made, although, of course,
      under much greater difficulties. Finally&mdash;and of this at the time I
      knew nothing&mdash;had I evaded them and got safe to port with my cargo,
      the plot would have been changed. Rupert&rsquo;s attention would then have been
      diverted from me to Rudolf; counting on love overcoming prudence, he
      reckoned that Mr. Rassendyll would not at once destroy what the queen
      sent, and had arranged to track his steps from Wintenberg till an
      opportunity offered of robbing him of his treasure. The scheme, as I know
      it, was full of audacious cunning, and required large resources&mdash;the
      former Rupert himself supplied; for the second he was indebted to his
      cousin and slave, the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      My meditations were interrupted by the arrival of the doctor. He hummed
      and ha&rsquo;d over me, but to my surprise asked me no questions as to the cause
      of my misfortune, and did not, as I had feared, suggest that his efforts
      should be seconded by those of the police. On the contrary, he appeared,
      from an unobtrusive hint or two, to be anxious that I should know that his
      discretion could be trusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not think of moving for a couple of days,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but then, I
      think we can get you away without danger and quite quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him; he promised to look in again; I murmured something about
      his fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, that is all settled,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your friend Herr Schmidt
      has seen to it, and, my dear sir, most liberally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was hardly gone when &lsquo;my friend Herr Schmidt&rsquo;&mdash;alias Rudolf
      Rassendyll&mdash;was back. He laughed a little when I told him how
      discreet the doctor had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;he thinks you&rsquo;ve been very indiscreet. I was
      obliged, my dear Fritz, to take some liberties with your character.
      However, it&rsquo;s odds against the matter coming to your wife&rsquo;s ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But couldn&rsquo;t we have laid the others by the heels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the letter on Rupert? My dear fellow, you&rsquo;re very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed at myself, and forgave Rudolf his trick, though I think that he
      might have made my fictitious inamorata something more than a baker&rsquo;s
      wife. It would have cost no more to make her a countess, and the doctor
      would have looked with more respect on me. However, Rudolf had said that
      the baker broke my head with his rolling-pin, and thus the story rests in
      the doctor&rsquo;s mind to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; said Rudolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to that same little station where two good friends parted from me
      once before. Fritz, where&rsquo;s Rupert gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lay he won&rsquo;t be far off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you armed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The six-shooter. Well, yes, since you press me, a knife, too; but only if
      he uses one. You&rsquo;ll let Sapt know when you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I come the moment I can stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if you need tell me that, old fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you go from the station?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Zenda, through the forest,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I shall reach the station
      about nine to-morrow night, Thursday. Unless Rischenheim has got the
      audience sooner than was arranged, I shall be in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will you get hold of Sapt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must leave something to the minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Rudolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have the letter, Fritz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence as we shook hands. Then that soft yet bright
      look came in his eyes again. He looked down at me, and caught me regarding
      him with a smile that I know was not unkind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought I should see her again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think I shall now,
      Fritz. To have a turn with that boy and to see her again&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will you see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf laughed, and I laughed too. He caught my hand again. I think that
      he was anxious to infect me with his gayety and confidence. But I could
      not answer to the appeal of his eyes. There was a motive in him that found
      no place in me&mdash;a great longing, the prospect or hope of whose sudden
      fulfilment dwarfed danger and banished despair. He saw that I detected its
      presence in him and perceived how it filled his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the letter comes before all,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I expected to die without
      seeing her; I will die without seeing her, if I must, to save the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you will,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed my hand again. As he turned away, James came with his
      noiseless, quick step into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage is at the door, sir,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look after the count, James,&rdquo; said Rudolf. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave him till he sends
      you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I raised myself in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck,&rdquo; I cried, catching up the lemonade James had brought me, and
      taking a gulp of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please God,&rdquo; said Rudolf, with a shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was gone to his work and his reward&mdash;to save the queen&rsquo;s
      letter and to see the queen&rsquo;s face. Thus he went a second time to Zenda.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. AN EDDY ON THE MOAT
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the evening of Thursday, the sixteenth of October, the Constable of
      Zenda was very much out of humor; he has since confessed as much. To risk
      the peace of a palace for the sake of a lover&rsquo;s greeting had never been
      wisdom to his mind, and he had been sorely impatient with &ldquo;that fool
      Fritz&rsquo;s&rdquo; yearly pilgrimage. The letter of farewell had been an added
      folly, pregnant with chances of disaster. Now disaster, or the danger of
      it, had come. The curt, mysterious telegram from Wintenberg, which told
      him so little, at least told him that. It ordered him&mdash;and he did not
      know even whose the order was&mdash;to delay Rischenheim&rsquo;s audience, or,
      if he could not, to get the king away from Zenda: why he was to act thus
      was not disclosed to him. But he knew as well as I that Rischenheim was
      completely in Rupert&rsquo;s hands, and he could not fail to guess that
      something had gone wrong at Wintenberg, and that Rischenheim came to tell
      the king some news that the king must not hear. His task sounded simple,
      but it was not easy; for he did not know where Rischenheim was, and so
      could not prevent his coming; besides, the king had been very pleased to
      learn of the count&rsquo;s approaching visit, since he desired to talk with him
      on the subject of a certain breed of dogs, which the count bred with
      great, his Majesty with only indifferent success; therefore he had
      declared that nothing should interfere with his reception of Rischenheim.
      In vain Sapt told him that a large boar had been seen in the forest, and
      that a fine day&rsquo;s sport might be expected if he would hunt next day. &ldquo;I
      shouldn&rsquo;t be back in time to see Rischenheim,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty would be back by nightfall,&rdquo; suggested Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be too tired to talk to him, and I&rsquo;ve a great deal to discuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could sleep at the hunting-lodge, sire, and ride back to receive the
      count next morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious to see him as soon as may be.&rdquo; Then he looked up at Sapt with
      a sick man&rsquo;s quick suspicion. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I see him?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity to miss the boar, sire,&rdquo; was all Sapt&rsquo;s plea. The king made
      light of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse the boar!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I want to know how he gets the dogs&rsquo; coats so
      fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the king spoke a servant entered, carrying a telegram for Sapt. The
      colonel took it and put it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; said the king. He had dined and was about to go to bed, it
      being nearly ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will keep, sire,&rdquo; answered Sapt, who did not know but that it might be
      from Wintenberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; insisted the king testily. &ldquo;It may be from Rischenheim. Perhaps
      he can get here sooner. I should like to know about those dogs. Read it, I
      beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt could do nothing but read it. He had taken to spectacles lately, and
      he spent a long while adjusting them and thinking what he should do if the
      message were not fit for the king&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Be quick, man, be quick!&rdquo; urged
      the irritable king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt had got the envelope open at last, and relief, mingled with
      perplexity, showed in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty guessed wonderfully well. Rischenheim can be here at eight
      to-morrow morning,&rdquo; he said, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;He shall breakfast with me at nine, and I&rsquo;ll
      have a ride after the boar when we&rsquo;ve done our business. Now are you
      satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, sire,&rdquo; said Sapt, biting his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king rose with a yawn, and bade the colonel good-night. &ldquo;He must have
      some trick I don&rsquo;t know with those dogs,&rdquo; he remarked, as he went out. And
      &ldquo;Damn the dogs!&rdquo; cried Colonel Sapt the moment that the door was shut
      behind his Majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the colonel was not a man to accept defeat easily. The audience that
      he had been instructed to postpone was advanced; the king, whom he had
      been told to get away from Zenda, would not go till he had seen
      Rischenheim. Still there are many ways of preventing a meeting. Some are
      by fraud; these it is no injustice to Sapt to say that he had tried; some
      are by force, and the colonel was being driven to the conclusion that one
      of these must be his resort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though the king,&rdquo; he mused, with a grin, &ldquo;will be furious if anything
      happens to Rischenheim before he&rsquo;s told him about the dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet he fell to racking his brains to find a means by which the count might
      be rendered incapable of performing the service so desired by the king and
      of carrying out his own purpose in seeking an audience. Nothing save
      assassination suggested itself to the constable; a quarrel and a duel
      offered no security; and Sapt was not Black Michael, and had no band of
      ruffians to join him in an apparently unprovoked kidnapping of a
      distinguished nobleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can think of nothing,&rdquo; muttered Sapt, rising from his chair and moving
      across towards the window in search of the fresh air that a man so often
      thinks will give him a fresh idea. He was in his own quarters, that room
      of the new chateau which opens on to the moat immediately to the right of
      the drawbridge as you face the old castle; it was the room which Duke
      Michael had occupied, and almost opposite to the spot where the great pipe
      had connected the window of the king&rsquo;s dungeon with the waters of the
      moat. The bridge was down now, for peaceful days had come to Zenda; the
      pipe was gone, and the dungeon&rsquo;s window, though still barred, was
      uncovered. The night was clear and fine, and the still water gleamed
      fitfully as the moon, half-full, escaped from or was hidden by passing
      clouds. Sapt stood staring out gloomily, beating his knuckles on the stone
      sill. The fresh air was there, but the fresh idea tarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the constable bent forward, craning his head out and down, far as
      he could stretch it, towards the water. What he had seen, or seemed dimly
      to see, is a sight common enough on the surface of water&mdash;large
      circular eddies, widening from a centre; a stone thrown in makes them, or
      a fish on the rise. But Sapt had thrown no stone, and the fish in the moat
      were few and not rising then. The light was behind Sapt, and threw his
      figure into bold relief. The royal apartments looked out the other way;
      there were no lights in the windows this side the bridge, although beyond
      it the guards&rsquo; lodgings and the servants&rsquo; offices still showed a light
      here and there. Sapt waited till the eddies ceased. Then he heard the
      faintest sound, as of a large body let very gently into the water; a
      moment later, from the moat right below him, a man&rsquo;s head emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sapt!&rdquo; said a voice, low but distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old colonel started, and, resting both hands on the sill, bent further
      out, till he seemed in danger of overbalancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick&mdash;to the ledge on the other side. You know,&rdquo; said the voice,
      and the head turned; with quick, quiet strokes the man crossed the moat
      till he was hidden in the triangle of deep shade formed by the meeting of
      the drawbridge and the old castle wall. Sapt watched him go, almost
      stupefied by the sudden wonder of hearing that voice come to him out of
      the stillness of the night. For the king was abed; and who spoke in that
      voice save the king and one other?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a curse at himself for his delay, he turned and walked quickly
      across the room. Opening the door, he found himself in the passage. But
      here he ran right into the arms of young Bernenstein, the officer of the
      guard, who was going his rounds. Sapt knew and trusted him, for he had
      been with us all through the siege of Zenda, when Michael kept the king a
      prisoner, and he bore marks given him by Rupert of Hentzau&rsquo;s ruffians. He
      now held a commission as lieutenant in the cuirassiers of the King&rsquo;s
      Guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed Sapt&rsquo;s bearing, for he cried out in a low voice, &ldquo;Anything
      wrong, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernenstein, my boy, the castle&rsquo;s all right about here. Go round to the
      front, and, hang you, stay there,&rdquo; said Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer stared, as well he might. Sapt caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, stay here. See, stand by the door there that leads to the royal
      apartments. Stand there, and let nobody pass. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whatever you hear, don&rsquo;t look round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernenstein&rsquo;s bewilderment grew greater; but Sapt was constable, and on
      Sapt&rsquo;s shoulders lay the responsibility for the safety of Zenda and all in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; he said, with a submissive shrug, and he drew his sword
      and stood by the door; he could obey, although he could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt ran on. Opening the gate that led to the bridge, he sped across.
      Then, stepping on one side and turning his face to the wall, he descended
      the steps that gave foothold down to the ledge running six or eight inches
      above the water. He also was now in the triangle of deep darkness, yet he
      knew that a man was there, who stood straight and tall, rising above his
      own height. And he felt his hand caught in a sudden grip. Rudolf
      Rassendyll was there, in his wet drawers and socks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Rudolf; &ldquo;I swam round from the other side and got here.
      Then I threw in a bit of mortar, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d roused you, and I
      didn&rsquo;t dare shout, so I followed it myself. Lay hold of me a minute while
      I get on my breeches: I didn&rsquo;t want to get wet, so I carried my clothes in
      a bundle. Hold me tight, it&rsquo;s slippery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name what brings you here?&rdquo; whispered Sapt, catching Rudolf by
      the arm as he was directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen&rsquo;s service. When does Rischenheim come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow at eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce! That&rsquo;s earlier than I thought. And the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is here and determined to see him. It&rsquo;s impossible to move him from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence; Rudolf drew his shirt over his head and
      tucked it into his trousers. &ldquo;Give me the jacket and waistcoat,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I feel deuced damp underneath, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon get dry,&rdquo; grinned Sapt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be kept moving, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me you&rsquo;ve lost your head too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find me both, eh, Sapt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As good as your own, anyhow,&rdquo; growled the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the boots, and I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo; Then he asked quickly, &ldquo;Has the king seen
      or heard from Rischenheim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither, except through me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why is he so set on seeing him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To find out what gives dogs smooth coats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re serious? Hang you, I can&rsquo;t see your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well, then. Has he got a beard now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound him! Can&rsquo;t you take me anywhere to talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce are you here at all for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To meet Rischenheim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To meet&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Sapt, he&rsquo;s got a copy of the queen&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt twirled his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said as much,&rdquo; he remarked in tones of satisfaction. He need
      not have said it; he would have been more than human not to think it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can you take me to?&rdquo; asked Rudolf impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any room with a door and a lock to it,&rdquo; answered old Sapt. &ldquo;I command
      here, and when I say &lsquo;Stay out&rsquo;&mdash;well, they don&rsquo;t come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king is in bed. Come along,&rdquo; and the constable set his toe on the
      lowest step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nobody about?&rdquo; asked Rudolf, catching his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernenstein; but he will keep his back toward us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your discipline is still good, then, Colonel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well for these days, your Majesty,&rdquo; grunted Sapt, as he reached
      the level of the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having crossed, they entered the chateau. The passage was empty, save for
      Bernenstein, whose broad back barred the way from the royal apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In here,&rdquo; whispered Sapt, laying his hand on the door of the room whence
      he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Rudolf. Bernenstein&rsquo;s hand twitched, but he did not
      look round. There was discipline in the castle of Zenda.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as Sapt was half-way through the door and Rudolf about to follow him,
      the other door, that which Bernenstein guarded, was softly yet swiftly
      opened. Bernenstein&rsquo;s sword was in rest in an instant. A muttered oath
      from Sapt and Rudolf&rsquo;s quick snatch at his breath greeted the
      interruption. Bernenstein did not look round, but his sword fell to his
      side. In the doorway stood Queen Flavia, all in white; and now her face
      turned white as her dress. For her eyes had fallen on Rudolf Rassendyll.
      For a moment the four stood thus; then Rudolf passed Sapt, thrust
      Bernenstein&rsquo;s brawny shoulders (the young man had not looked round) out of
      the way, and, falling on his knee before the queen, seized her hand and
      kissed it. Bernenstein could see now without looking round, and if
      astonishment could kill, he would have been a dead man that instant. He
      fairly reeled and leant against the wall, his mouth hanging open. For the
      king was in bed, and had a beard; yet there was the king, fully dressed
      and clean shaven, and he was kissing the queen&rsquo;s hand, while she gazed
      down on him in a struggle between amazement, fright, and joy. A soldier
      should be prepared for anything, but I cannot be hard on young
      Bernenstein&rsquo;s bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there was in truth nothing strange in the queen seeking to see old
      Sapt that night, nor in her guessing where he would most probably be
      found. For she had asked him three times whether news had come from
      Wintenberg and each time he had put her off with excuses. Quick to forbode
      evil, and conscious of the pledge to fortune that she had given in her
      letter, she had determined to know from him whether there were really
      cause for alarm, and had stolen, undetected, from her apartments to seek
      him. What filled her at once with unbearable apprehension and incredulous
      joy was to find Rudolf present in actual flesh and blood, no longer in sad
      longing dreams or visions, and to feel his live lips on her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovers count neither time nor danger; but Sapt counted both, and no more
      than a moment had passed before, with eager imperative gestures, he
      beckoned them to enter the room. The queen obeyed, and Rudolf followed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let nobody in, and don&rsquo;t say a word to anybody,&rdquo; whispered Sapt, as he
      entered, leaving Bernenstein outside. The young man was half-dazed still,
      but he had sense to read the expression in the constable&rsquo;s eyes and to
      learn from it that he must give his life sooner than let the door be
      opened. So with drawn sword he stood on guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was eleven o&rsquo;clock when the queen came, and midnight had struck from
      the great clock of the castle before the door opened again and Sapt came
      out. His sword was not drawn, but he had his revolver in his hand. He shut
      the door silently after him and began at once to talk in low, earnest,
      quick tones to Bernenstein. Bernenstein listened intently and without
      interrupting. Sapt&rsquo;s story ran on for eight or nine minutes. Then he
      paused, before asking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is wonderful,&rdquo; said the young man, drawing in his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Sapt. &ldquo;Nothing is wonderful: some things are unusual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernenstein was not convinced, and shrugged his shoulders in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the constable, with a quick glance at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would die for the queen, sir,&rdquo; he answered, clicking his heels together
      as though on parade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Sapt. &ldquo;Then listen,&rdquo; and he began again to talk. Bernenstein
      nodded from time to time. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll meet him at the gate,&rdquo; said the
      constable, &ldquo;and bring him straight here. He&rsquo;s not to go anywhere else, you
      understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, Colonel,&rdquo; smiled young Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king will be in this room&mdash;the king. You know who is the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when the interview is ended, and we go to breakfast&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know who will be the king then. Yes, Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. But we do him no harm unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt turned away with a little sigh. Bernenstein was an apt pupil, but the
      colonel was exhausted by so much explanation. He knocked softly at the
      door of the room. The queen&rsquo;s voice bade him enter, and he passed in.
      Bernenstein was left alone again in the passage, pondering over what he
      had heard and rehearsing the part that it now fell to him to play. As he
      thought he may well have raised his head proudly. The service seemed so
      great and the honor so high, that he almost wished he could die in the
      performing of his role. It would be a finer death than his soldier&rsquo;s
      dreams had dared to picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock Colonel Sapt came out. &ldquo;Go to bed till six,&rdquo; said he to
      Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sleepy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you will be at eight if you don&rsquo;t sleep now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the queen coming out, Colonel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a minute, Lieutenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to kiss her hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you think it worth waiting a quarter of an hour for!&rdquo; said Sapt,
      with a slight smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said a minute, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did she,&rdquo; answered the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless it was a quarter of an hour before Rudolf Rassendyll opened
      the door and the queen appeared on the threshold. She was very pale, and
      she had been crying, but her eyes were happy and her air firm. The moment
      he saw her, young Bernenstein fell on his knee and raised her hand to his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the death, madame,&rdquo; said he, in a trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it, sir,&rdquo; she answered graciously. Then she looked round on the
      three of them. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;my servants and dear friends, with
      you, and with Fritz who lies wounded in Wintenberg, rest my honor and my
      life; for I will not live if the letter reaches the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king shall not have it, madame,&rdquo; said Colonel Sapt. He took her hand
      in his and patted it with a clumsy gentleness; smiling, she extended it
      again to young Bernenstein, in mark of her favor. They two then stood at
      the salute, while Rudolf walked with her to the end of the passage. There
      for a moment she and he stood together; the others turned their eyes away
      and thus did not see her suddenly stoop and cover his hand with her
      kisses. He tried to draw it away, not thinking it fit that she should kiss
      his hand, but she seemed as though she could not let it go. Yet at last,
      still with her eyes on his, she passed backwards through the door, and he
      shut it after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now to business,&rdquo; said Colonel Sapt dryly; and Rudolf laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf passed into the room. Sapt went to the king&rsquo;s apartments, and asked
      the physician whether his Majesty were sleeping well. Receiving reassuring
      news of the royal slumbers, he proceeded to the quarters of the king&rsquo;s
      body-servant, knocked up the sleepy wretch, and ordered breakfast for the
      king and the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim at nine o&rsquo;clock precisely, in the
      morning-room that looked out over the avenue leading to the entrance to
      the new chateau. This done, he returned to the room where Rudolf was,
      carried a chair into the passage, bade Rudolf lock the door, sat down,
      revolver in hand, and himself went to sleep. Young Bernenstein was in bed
      just now, taken faint, and the constable himself was acting as his
      substitute; that was to be the story, if a story were needed. Thus the
      hours from two to six passed that morning in the castle of Zenda.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six the constable awoke and knocked at the door; Rudolf Rassendyll
      opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slept well?&rdquo; asked Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a wink,&rdquo; answered Rudolf cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had more nerve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t want of nerve that kept me awake,&rdquo; said Mr. Rassendyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt, with a pitying shrug, looked round. The curtains of the window were
      half-drawn. The table was moved near to the wall, and the arm-chair by it
      was well in shadow, being quite close to the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of room for you behind,&rdquo; said Rudolf; &ldquo;And when
      Rischenheim is seated in his chair opposite to mine, you can put your
      barrel against his head by just stretching out your hand. And of course I
      can do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it looks well enough,&rdquo; said Sapt, with an approving nod. &ldquo;What about
      the beard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernenstein is to tell him you&rsquo;ve shaved this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he believe that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? For his own sake he&rsquo;d better believe everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if we have to kill him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must run for it. The king would be furious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fond of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget. He wants to know about the dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. You&rsquo;ll be in your place in time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf Rassendyll took a turn up and down the room. It was easy to see
      that the events of the night had disturbed him. Sapt&rsquo;s thoughts were
      running in a different channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we&rsquo;ve done with this fellow, we must find Rupert,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rupert? Rupert? True; I forgot. Of course we must,&rdquo; said he confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt looked scornful; he knew that his companion&rsquo;s mind had been occupied
      with the queen. But his remarks&mdash;if he had meditated any&mdash;were
      interrupted by the clock striking seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here in an hour,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready for him,&rdquo; answered Rudolf Rassendyll. With the thought of
      action his eyes grew bright and his brow smooth again. He and old Sapt
      looked at one another, and they both smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like old times, isn&rsquo;t it, Sapt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, sire, like the reign of good King Rudolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus they made ready for the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim, while my cursed
      wound held me a prisoner at Wintenberg. It is still a sorrow to me that I
      know what passed that morning only by report, and had not the honor of
      bearing a part in it. Still, her Majesty did not forget me, but remembered
      that I would have taken my share, had fortune allowed. Indeed I would most
      eagerly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. AN AUDIENCE OF THE KING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Having come thus far in the story that I set out to tell, I have half a
      mind to lay down my pen, and leave untold how from the moment that Mr.
      Rassendyll came again to Zenda a fury of chance seemed to catch us all in
      a whirlwind, carrying us whither we would not, and ever driving us onwards
      to fresh enterprises, breathing into us a recklessness that stood at no
      obstacle, and a devotion to the queen and to the man she loved that swept
      away all other feeling. The ancients held there to be a fate which would
      have its fill, though women wept and men died, and none could tell whose
      was the guilt nor who fell innocent. Thus did they blindly wrong God&rsquo;s
      providence. Yet, save that we are taught to believe that all is ruled, we
      are as blind as they, and are still left wondering why all that is true
      and generous and love&rsquo;s own fruit must turn so often to woe and shame,
      exacting tears and blood. For myself I would leave the thing untold, lest
      a word of it should seem to stain her whom I serve; it is by her own
      command I write, that all may one day, in time&rsquo;s fullness, be truly known,
      and those condemn who are without sin, while they pity whose own hearts
      have fought the equal fight. So much for her and him; for us less needs be
      said. It was not ours to weigh her actions; we served her; him we had
      served. She was our queen; we bore Heaven a grudge that he was not our
      king. The worst of what befell was not of our own planning, no, nor of our
      hoping. It came a thunderbolt from the hand of Rupert, flung carelessly
      between a curse and a laugh; its coming entangled us more tightly in the
      net of circumstances. Then there arose in us that strange and overpowering
      desire of which I must tell later, filling us with a zeal to accomplish
      our purpose, and to force Mr. Rassendyll himself into the way we chose.
      Led by this star, we pressed on through the darkness, until at length the
      deeper darkness fell that stayed our steps. We also stand for judgment,
      even as she and he. So I will write; but I will write plainly and briefly,
      setting down what I must, and no more, yet seeking to give truly the
      picture of that time, and to preserve as long as may be the portrait of
      the man whose like I have not known. Yet the fear is always upon me that,
      failing to show him as he was, I may fail also in gaining an understanding
      of how he wrought on us, one and all, till his cause became in all things
      the right, and to seat him where he should be our highest duty and our
      nearest wish. For he said little, and that straight to the purpose; no
      high-flown words of his live in my memory. And he asked nothing for
      himself. Yet his speech and his eyes went straight to men&rsquo;s hearts and
      women&rsquo;s, so that they held their lives in an eager attendance on his
      bidding. Do I rave? Then Sapt was a raver too, for Sapt was foremost in
      the business.

    <p>
      At ten minutes to eight o&rsquo;clock, young Bernenstein, very admirably and
      smartly accoutred, took his stand outside the main entrance of the castle.
      He wore a confident air that became almost a swagger as he strolled to and
      fro past the motionless sentries. He had not long to wait. On the stroke
      of eight a gentleman, well-horsed but entirely unattended, rode up the
      carriage drive. Bernenstein, crying &ldquo;Ah, it is the count!&rdquo; ran to meet
      him. Rischenheim dismounted, holding out his hand to the young officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Bernenstein!&rdquo; said he, for they were acquainted with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re punctual, my dear Rischenheim, and it&rsquo;s lucky, for the king awaits
      you most impatiently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to find him up so soon,&rdquo; remarked Rischenheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up! He&rsquo;s been up these two hours. Indeed we&rsquo;ve had the devil of a time of
      it. Treat him carefully, my dear Count; he&rsquo;s in one of his troublesome
      humors. For example&mdash;but I mustn&rsquo;t keep you waiting. Pray follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but pray tell me. Otherwise I might say something unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he woke at six; and when the barber came to trim his beard there
      were&mdash;imagine it, Count!&mdash;no less than seven gray hairs.&rdquo; The
      king fell into a passion. &ldquo;Take it off!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take it off. I won&rsquo;t
      have a gray beard! Take it off!&rsquo; Well what would you? A man is free to be
      shaved if he chooses, so much more a king. So it&rsquo;s taken off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His beard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His beard, my dear Count.&rdquo; Then, after thanking Heaven it was gone, and
      declaring he looked ten years younger, he cried, &ldquo;The Count of
      Luzau-Rischenheim breakfasts with me to-day: what is there for breakfast?&rdquo;
       And he had the chef out of his bed and&mdash;&ldquo;But, by heavens, I shall get
      into trouble if I stop here chattering. He&rsquo;s waiting most eagerly for you.
      Come along.&rdquo; And Bernenstein, passing his arm through the count&rsquo;s, walked
      him rapidly into the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count of Luzau-Rischenheim was a young man; he was no more versed in
      affairs of this kind than Bernenstein, and it cannot be said that he
      showed so much aptitude for them. He was decidedly pale this morning; his
      manner was uneasy, and his hands trembled. He did not lack courage, but
      that rarer virtue, coolness; and the importance&mdash;or perhaps the shame&mdash;of
      his mission upset the balance of his nerves. Hardly noting where he went,
      he allowed Bernenstein to lead him quickly and directly towards the room
      where Rudolf Rassendyll was, not doubting that he was being conducted to
      the king&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast is ordered for nine,&rdquo; said Bernenstein, &ldquo;but he wants to see
      you before. He has something important to say; and you perhaps have the
      same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh, no. A small matter; but&mdash;er&mdash;of a private nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, quite so. Oh, I don&rsquo;t ask any questions, my dear Count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I find the king alone?&rdquo; asked Rischenheim nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll find anybody with him; no, nobody, I think,&rdquo;
       answered Bernenstein, with a grave and reassuring air.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived now at the door. Here Bernenstein paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ordered to wait outside till his Majesty summons me,&rdquo; he said in a
      low voice, as though he feared that the irritable king would hear him.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open the door and announce you. Pray keep him in a good temper, for
      all our sakes.&rdquo; And he flung the door open, saying, &ldquo;Sire, the Count of
      Luzau-Rischenheim has the honor to wait on your Majesty.&rdquo; With this he
      shut the door promptly, and stood against it. Nor did he move, save once,
      and then only to take out his revolver and carefully inspect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count advanced, bowing low, and striving to conceal a visible
      agitation. He saw the king in his arm-chair; the king wore a suit of brown
      tweeds (none the better for being crushed into a bundle the night before);
      his face was in deep shadow, but Rischenheim perceived that the beard was
      indeed gone. The king held out his hand to Rischenheim, and motioned him
      to sit in a chair just opposite to him and within a foot of the
      window-curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to see you, my lord,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim looked up. Rudolf&rsquo;s voice had once been so like the king&rsquo;s
      that no man could tell the difference, but in the last year or two the
      king&rsquo;s had grown weaker, and Rischenheim seemed to be struck by the vigor
      of the tones in which he was addressed. As he looked up, there was a
      slight movement in the curtains by him; it died away when the count gave
      no further signs of suspicion, but Rudolf had noticed his surprise: the
      voice, when it next spoke, was subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most delighted,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Rassendyll. &ldquo;For I am pestered beyond
      endurance about those dogs. I can&rsquo;t get the coats right, I&rsquo;ve tried
      everything, but they won&rsquo;t come as I wish. Now, yours are magnificent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good, sire. But I ventured to ask an audience in order to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively you must tell me about the dogs. And before Sapt comes, for I
      want nobody to hear but myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty expects Colonel Sapt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In about twenty minutes,&rdquo; said the king, with a glance at the clock on
      the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Rischenheim became all on fire to get his errand done before Sapt
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coats of your dogs,&rdquo; pursued the king, &ldquo;grow so beautifully&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons, sire, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long and silky, that I despair of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a most urgent and important matter,&rdquo; persisted Rischenheim in
      agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf threw himself back in his chair with a peevish air. &ldquo;Well, if you
      must, you must. What is this great affair, Count? Let us have it over, and
      then you can tell me about the dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim looked round the room. There was nobody; the curtains were
      still; the king&rsquo;s left hand caressed his beardless chin; the right was
      hidden from his visitor by the small table that stood between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, my cousin, the Count of Hentzau, has entrusted me with a message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf suddenly assumed a stern air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hold no communication, directly or indirectly, with the Count of
      Hentzau,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sire, pardon me. A document has come into the count&rsquo;s hands
      which is of vital importance to your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count of Hentzau, my lord, has incurred my heaviest displeasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it is in the hopes of atoning for his offences that he has sent me
      here to-day. There is a conspiracy against your Majesty&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom, my lord?&rdquo; asked Rudolf, in cold and doubting tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By those who are very near your Majesty&rsquo;s person and very high in your
      Majesty&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I dare not. You would not believe me. But your Majesty will believe
      written evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show it me, and quickly. We may be interrupted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I have a copy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a copy, my lord?&rdquo; sneered Rudolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin has the original, and will forward it at your Majesty&rsquo;s
      command. A copy of a letter of her Majesty&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the queen&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire. It is addressed to&mdash;&rdquo; Rischenheim paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my lord, to whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a Mr. Rudolf Rassendyll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Rudolf played his part well. He did not feign indifference, but
      allowed his voice to tremble with emotion as he stretched out his hand and
      said in a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;Give it me, give it me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. His shot had told: the king&rsquo;s attention was
      his; the coats of the dogs were forgotten. Plainly he had stirred the
      suspicions and jealousy of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;conceives it his duty to lay the letter before
      your Majesty. He obtained it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A curse on how he got it! Give it me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim unbuttoned his coat, then his waistcoat. The head of a
      revolver showed in a belt round his waist. He undid the flap of a pocket
      in the lining of his waistcoat, and he began to draw out a sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rudolf, great as his powers of self-control were, was but human. When
      he saw the paper, he leant forward, half rising from his chair. As a
      result, his face came beyond the shadow of the curtain, and the full
      morning light beat on it. As Rischenheim took the paper out, he looked up.
      He saw the face that glared so eagerly at him; his eyes met Rassendyll&rsquo;s:
      a sudden suspicion seized him, for the face, though the king&rsquo;s face in
      every feature, bore a stern resolution and witnessed a vigor that were not
      the king&rsquo;s. In that instant the truth, or a hint of it, flashed across his
      mind. He gave a half-articulate cry; in one hand he crumpled up the paper,
      the other flew to his revolver. But he was too late. Rudolf&rsquo;s left hand
      encircled his hand and the paper in an iron grip; Rudolf&rsquo;s revolver was on
      his temple; and an arm was stretched out from behind the curtain, holding
      another barrel full before his eyes, while a dry voice said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best
      take it quietly.&rdquo; Then Sapt stepped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim had no words to meet the sudden transformation of the
      interview. He seemed to be able to do nothing but stare at Rudolf
      Rassendyll. Sapt wasted no time. He snatched the count&rsquo;s revolver and
      stowed it in his own pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now take the paper,&rdquo; said he to Rudolf, and his barrel held Rischenheim
      motionless while Rudolf wrenched the precious document from his fingers.
      &ldquo;Look if it&rsquo;s the right one. No, don&rsquo;t read it through; just look. Is it
      right? That&rsquo;s good. Now put your revolver to his head again. I&rsquo;m going to
      search him. Stand up, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They compelled the count to stand up, and Sapt subjected him to a search
      that made the concealment of another copy, or of any other document,
      impossible. Then they let him sit down again. His eyes seemed fascinated
      by Rudolf Rassendyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you&rsquo;ve seen me before, I think,&rdquo; smiled Rudolf. &ldquo;I seem to remember
      you as a boy in Strelsau when I was there. Now tell us, sir, where did you
      leave this cousin of yours?&rdquo; For the plan was to find out from Rischenheim
      where Rupert was, and to set off in pursuit of Rupert as soon as they had
      disposed of Rischenheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as Rudolf spoke there was a violent knock at the door. Rudolf
      sprang to open it. Sapt and his revolver kept their places. Bernenstein
      was on the threshold, open-mouthed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s servant has just gone by. He&rsquo;s looking for Colonel Sapt. The
      King has been walking in the drive, and learnt from a sentry of
      Rischenheim&rsquo;s arrival. I told the man that you had taken the count for a
      stroll round the castle, and I did not know where you were. He says that
      the king may come himself at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt considered for one short instant; then he was back by the prisoner&rsquo;s
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must talk again later on,&rdquo; he said, in low quick tones. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re
      going to breakfast with the king. I shall be there, and Bernenstein.
      Remember, not a word of your errand, not a word of this gentleman! At a
      word, a sign, a hint, a gesture, a motion, as God lives, I&rsquo;ll put a bullet
      through your head, and a thousand kings sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stop me. Rudolf, get
      behind the curtain. If there&rsquo;s an alarm you must jump through the window
      into the moat and swim for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Rudolf Rassendyll. &ldquo;I can read my letter there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burn it, you fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve read it I&rsquo;ll eat it, if you like, but not before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernenstein looked in again. &ldquo;Quick, quick! The man will be back,&rdquo; he
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernenstein, did you hear what I said to the count?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know your part. Now, gentlemen, to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said an angry voice outside, &ldquo;I wondered how long I was to be kept
      waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf Rassendyll skipped behind the curtain. Sapt&rsquo;s revolver slipped into
      a handy pocket. Rischenheim stood with arms dangling by his side and his
      waistcoat half unbuttoned. Young Bernenstein was bowing low on the
      threshold, and protesting that the king&rsquo;s servant had but just gone, and
      that they were on the point of waiting on his Majesty. Then the king
      walked in, pale and full-bearded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Count,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you. If they had told me you were
      here, you shouldn&rsquo;t have waited a minute. You&rsquo;re very dark in here, Sapt.
      Why don&rsquo;t you draw back the curtains?&rdquo; and the king moved towards the
      curtain behind which Rudolf was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me, sire,&rdquo; cried Sapt, darting past him and laying a hand on the
      curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A malicious gleam of pleasure shot into Rischenheim&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;In truth,
      sire,&rdquo; continued the constable, his hand on the curtain, &ldquo;we were so
      interested in what the count was saying about his dogs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heaven, I forgot!&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;Yes, yes, the dogs. Now tell me,
      Count&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, sire,&rdquo; put in young Bernenstein, &ldquo;but breakfast waits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. Well, then, we&rsquo;ll have them together&mdash;breakfast and the
      dogs. Come along, Count.&rdquo; The king passed his arm through Rischenheim&rsquo;s,
      adding to Bernenstein, &ldquo;Lead the way, Lieutenant; and you, Colonel, come
      with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went out. Sapt stopped and locked the door behind him. &ldquo;Why do you
      lock the door, Colonel?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some papers in my drawer there, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not lock the drawer?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lost the key, sire, like the fool I am,&rdquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count of Luzau-Rischenheim did not make a very good breakfast. He sat
      opposite to the king. Colonel Sapt placed himself at the back of the
      king&rsquo;s chair, and Rischenheim saw the muzzle of a revolver resting on the
      top of the chair just behind his Majesty&rsquo;s right ear. Bernenstein stood in
      soldierly rigidity by the door; Rischenheim looked round at him once and
      met a most significant gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re eating nothing,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not indisposed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a little upset, sire,&rdquo; stammered Rischenheim, and truly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell me about the dogs&mdash;while I eat, for I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim began to disclose his secret. His statement was decidedly
      wanting in clearness. The king grew impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said he testily, and he pushed his chair back so
      quickly that Sapt skipped away, and hid the revolver behind his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire&mdash;&rdquo; cried Rischenheim, half rising. A cough from Lieutenant von
      Bernenstein interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell it me all over again,&rdquo; said the king. Rischenheim did as he was bid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I understand a little better now. Do you see, Sapt?&rdquo; and he turned
      his head round towards the constable. Sapt had just time to whisk the
      revolver away. The count lent forward towards the king. Lieutenant von
      Bernenstein coughed. The count sank back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, sire,&rdquo; said Colonel Sapt. &ldquo;I understand all the count wishes
      to convey to your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I understand about half,&rdquo; said the king with a laugh. &ldquo;But perhaps
      that&rsquo;ll be enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think quite enough, sire,&rdquo; answered Sapt with a smile. The important
      matter of the dogs being thus disposed of, the king recollected that the
      count had asked for an audience on a matter of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what did you wish to say to me?&rdquo; he asked, with a weary air. The
      dogs had been more interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim looked at Sapt. The revolver was in its place; Bernenstein
      coughed again. Yet he saw a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, sire,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but we are not alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king lifted his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the business so private?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer to tell it to your Majesty alone,&rdquo; pleaded the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Sapt was resolved not to leave Rischenheim alone with the king, for,
      although the count, being robbed of his evidence could do little harm
      concerning the letter, he would doubtless tell the king that Rudolf
      Rassendyll was in the castle. He leant now over the king&rsquo;s shoulder, and
      said with a sneer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messages from Rupert of Hentzau are too exalted matters for my poor ears,
      it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king flushed red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your business, my lord?&rdquo; he asked Rischenheim sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty does not know what my cousin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the old plea?&rdquo; interrupted the king. &ldquo;He wants to come back? Is
      that all, or is there anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment&rsquo;s silence followed the king&rsquo;s words. Sapt looked full at
      Rischenheim, and smiled as he slightly raised his right hand and showed
      the revolver. Bernenstein coughed twice. Rischenheim sat twisting his
      fingers. He understood that, cost what it might, they would not let him
      declare his errand to the king or betray Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s presence. He
      cleared his throat and opened his mouth as if to speak, but still he
      remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my lord, is it the old story or something new,&rdquo; asked the king
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Rischenheim sat silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you dumb, my lord?&rdquo; cried the king most impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it is only what you call the old story, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me say that you have treated me very badly in obtaining an
      audience of me for any such purpose,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;You knew my
      decision, and your cousin knows it.&rdquo; Thus speaking, the king rose; Sapt&rsquo;s
      revolver slid into his pocket; but Lieutenant von Bernenstein drew his
      sword and stood at the salute; he also coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Rischenheim,&rdquo; pursued the king more kindly, &ldquo;I can allow for your
      natural affection. But, believe me, in this case it misleads you. Do me
      the favor not to open this subject again to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim, humiliated and angry, could do nothing but bow in
      acknowledgment of the king&rsquo;s rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Sapt, see that the count is well entertained. My horse should be
      at the door by now. Farewell, Count. Bernenstein, give me your arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernenstein shot a rapid glance at the constable. Sapt nodded
      reassuringly. Bernenstein sheathed his sword and gave his arm to the king.
      They passed through the door, and Bernenstein closed it with a backward
      push of his hand. But at this moment Rischenheim, goaded to fury and
      desperate at the trick played on him&mdash;seeing, moreover, that he had
      now only one man to deal with&mdash;made a sudden rush at the door. He
      reached it, and his hand was on the door-knob. But Sapt was upon him, and
      Sapt&rsquo;s revolver was at his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the passage the king stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they doing in there?&rdquo; he asked, hearing the noise of the quick
      movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sire,&rdquo; said Bernenstein, and he took a step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, stop a minute, Lieutenant; you&rsquo;re pulling me along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear nothing more now.&rdquo; And there was nothing to hear, for the two now
      stood dead silent inside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, sire. Will your Majesty go on?&rdquo; And Bernenstein took another step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re determined I shall,&rdquo; said the king with a laugh, and he let the
      young officer lead him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the room, Rischenheim stood with his back against the door. He was
      panting for breath, and his face was flushed and working with excitement.
      Opposite to him stood Sapt, revolver in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till you get to heaven, my lord,&rdquo; said the constable, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never be
      nearer to it than you were in that moment. If you had opened the door, I&rsquo;d
      have shot you through the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke there came a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it,&rdquo; he said brusquely to Rischenheim. With a muttered curse the
      count obeyed him. A servant stood outside with a telegram on a salver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; whispered Sapt, and Rischenheim put out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, my lord, but this has arrived for you,&rdquo; said the man
      respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; whispered Sapt again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it me,&rdquo; muttered Rischenheim confusedly; and he took the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant bowed and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it,&rdquo; commanded Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s curse on you!&rdquo; cried Rischenheim in a voice that choked with
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, you can have no secrets from so good a friend as I am, my lord.
      Be quick and open it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The count began to open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you tear it up, or crumple it, I&rsquo;ll shoot you,&rdquo; said Sapt quietly.
      &ldquo;You know you can trust my word. Now read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, I won&rsquo;t read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it, I tell you, or say your prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The muzzle was within a foot of his head. He unfolded the telegram. Then
      he looked at Sapt. &ldquo;Read,&rdquo; said the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what it means,&rdquo; grumbled Rischenheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly I may be able to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read, my lord, read!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he read, and this was the telegram: &ldquo;Holf, 19 Konigstrasse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks, my lord. And&mdash;the place it&rsquo;s despatched from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strelsau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just turn it so that I can see. Oh, I don&rsquo;t doubt you, but seeing is
      believing. Ah, thanks. It&rsquo;s as you say. You&rsquo;re puzzled what it means,
      Count?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know at all what it means!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange! Because I can guess so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very acute, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me a simple thing to guess, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray,&rdquo; said Rischenheim, endeavoring to assume an easy and sarcastic
      air, &ldquo;what does your wisdom tell you that the message means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, my lord, that the message is an address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An address! I never thought of that. But I know no Holf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s Holf&rsquo;s address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose, then?&rdquo; asked Rischenheim, biting his nail, and looking furtively
      at the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Sapt, &ldquo;the present address of Count Rupert of Hentzau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he fixed his eyes on the eyes of Rischenheim. He gave a
      short, sharp laugh, then put his revolver in his pocket and bowed to the
      count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, you are very convenient, my dear Count,&rdquo; said he.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. THE TASK OF THE QUEEN&rsquo;S SERVANTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE doctor who attended me at Wintenberg was not only discreet, but also
      indulgent; perhaps he had the sense to see that little benefit would come
      to a sick man from fretting in helplessness on his back, when he was on
      fire to be afoot. I fear he thought the baker&rsquo;s rolling-pin was in my
      mind, but at any rate I extorted a consent from him, and was on my way
      home from Wintenberg not much more than twelve hours after Rudolf
      Rassendyll left me. Thus I arrived at my own house in Strelsau on the same
      Friday morning that witnessed the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim&rsquo;s two-fold
      interview with the king at the Castle of Zenda. The moment I had arrived,
      I sent James, whose assistance had been, and continued to be, in all
      respects most valuable, to despatch a message to the constable,
      acquainting him with my whereabouts, and putting myself entirely at his
      disposal. Sapt received this message while a council of war was being
      held, and the information it gave aided not a little in the arrangements
      that the constable and Rudolf Rassendyll made. What these were I must now
      relate, although, I fear, at the risk of some tediousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet that council of war in Zenda was held under no common circumstances.
      Cowed as Rischenheim appeared, they dared not let him out of their sight.
      Rudolf could not leave the room into which Sapt had locked him; the king&rsquo;s
      absence was to be short, and before he came again Rudolf must be gone,
      Rischenheim safely disposed of, and measures taken against the original
      letter reaching the hands for which the intercepted copy had been
      destined. The room was a large one. In the corner farthest from the door
      sat Rischenheim, disarmed, dispirited, to all seeming ready to throw up
      his dangerous game and acquiesce in any terms presented to him. Just
      inside the door, guarding it, if need should be, with their lives, were
      the other three, Bernenstein merry and triumphant, Sapt blunt and cool,
      Rudolf calm and clear-headed. The queen awaited the result of their
      deliberations in her apartments, ready to act as they directed, but
      determined to see Rudolf before he left the castle. They conversed
      together in low tones. Presently Sapt took paper and wrote. This first
      message was to me, and it bade me come to Zenda that afternoon; another
      head and another pair of hands were sadly needed. Then followed more
      deliberation; Rudolf took up the talking now, for his was the bold plan on
      which they consulted. Sapt twirled his moustache, smiling doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; murmured young Bernenstein, his eyes alight with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous, but the best thing,&rdquo; said Rudolf, carefully sinking his
      voice yet lower, lest the prisoner should catch the lightest word of what
      he said. &ldquo;It involves my staying here till the evening. Is that possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but you can leave here and hide in the forest till I join you,&rdquo; said
      Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till we join you,&rdquo; corrected Bernenstein eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the constable, &ldquo;you must look after our friend here. Come,
      Lieutenant, it&rsquo;s all in the queen&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Rudolf with a smile, &ldquo;neither the colonel nor I would let
      you have a chance at Rupert. He&rsquo;s our game, isn&rsquo;t he, Sapt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonel nodded. Rudolf in his turn took paper, and here is the message
      that he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holf, 19, Konigstrasse, Strelsau.&mdash;All well. He has what I had, but
      wishes to see what you have. He and I will be at the hunting-lodge at ten
      this evening. Bring it and meet us. The business is unsuspected.&mdash;R.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf threw the paper across to Sapt; Bernenstein leant over the
      constable&rsquo;s shoulder and read it eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if it would bring me,&rdquo; grinned old Sapt, throwing the paper down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll bring Rupert to Hentzau. Why not? He&rsquo;ll know that the king will
      wish to meet him unknown to the queen, and also unknown to you, Sapt,
      since you were my friend: what place more likely for the king to choose
      than his hunting-lodge, where he is accustomed to go when he wishes to be
      alone? The message will bring him, depend on it. Why, man, Rupert would
      come even if he suspected; and why should he suspect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may have a cipher, he and Rischenheim,&rdquo; objected Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, or Rupert would have sent the address in it,&rdquo; retorted Rudolf
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;when he comes?&rdquo; asked Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He finds such a king as Rischenheim found, and Sapt, here, at his elbow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll know you,&rdquo; objected Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I think he&rsquo;ll know me,&rdquo; said Rudolf with a smile. &ldquo;Meanwhile we send
      for Fritz to come here and look after the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Rischenheim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your share, Lieutenant. Sapt, is any one at Tarlenheim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Count Stanislas has put it at Fritz&rsquo;s disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good; then Fritz&rsquo;s two friends, the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim and
      Lieutenant von Bernenstein, will ride over there to-day. The constable of
      Zenda will give the lieutenant twenty-four hours&rsquo; leave of absence, and
      the two gentlemen will pass the day and sleep at the chateau. They will
      pass the day side by side, Bernenstein, not losing sight of one another
      for an instant, and they will pass the night in the same room. And one of
      them will not close his eyes nor take his hand off the butt of his
      revolver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said young Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he tries to escape or give any alarm, shoot him through the head, ride
      to the frontier, get to safe hiding, and, if you can, let us know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bernenstein simply. Sapt had chosen well, and the young
      officer made nothing of the peril and ruin that her Majesty&rsquo;s service
      might ask of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A restless movement and a weary sigh from Rischenheim attracted their
      attention. He had strained his ears to listen till his head ached, but the
      talkers had been careful, and he had heard nothing that threw light on
      their deliberations. He had now given up his vain attempt, and sat in
      listless inattention, sunk in an apathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll give you much trouble,&rdquo; whispered Sapt to
      Bernenstein, with a jerk of his thumb towards the captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Act as if he were likely to give you much,&rdquo; urged Rudolf, laying his hand
      on the lieutenant&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a wise man&rsquo;s advice,&rdquo; nodded the constable approvingly. &ldquo;We
      were well governed, Lieutenant, when this Rudolf was king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I also his loyal subject?&rdquo; asked young Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, wounded in my service,&rdquo; added Rudolf; for he remembered how the boy&mdash;he
      was little more then&mdash;had been fired upon in the park of Tarlenheim,
      being taken for Mr. Rassendyll himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus their plans were laid. If they could defeat Rupert, they would have
      Rischenheim at their mercy. If they could keep Rischenheim out of the way
      while they used his name in their trick, they had a strong chance of
      deluding and killing Rupert. Yes, of killing him; for that and nothing
      less was their purpose, as the constable of Zenda himself has told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We would have stood on no ceremony,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The queen&rsquo;s honor was at
      stake, and the fellow himself an assassin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernenstein rose and went out. He was gone about half an hour, being
      employed in despatching the telegrams to Strelsau. Rudolf and Sapt used
      the interval to explain to Rischenheim what they proposed to do with him.
      They asked no pledge, and he offered none. He heard what they said with a
      dulled uninterested air. When asked if he would go without resistance, he
      laughed a bitter laugh. &ldquo;How can I resist?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I should have a
      bullet through my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, without doubt,&rdquo; said Colonel Sapt. &ldquo;My lord, you are very sensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me advise you, my lord,&rdquo; said Rudolf, looking down on him kindly
      enough, &ldquo;if you come safe through this affair, to add honor to your
      prudence, and chivalry to your honor. There is still time for you to
      become a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, followed by a glance of anger from the count and a grating
      chuckle from old Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Bernenstein returned. His errand was done, and horses
      for himself and Rischenheim were at the gate of the castle. After a few
      final words and clasp of the hand from Rudolf, the lieutenant motioned to
      his prisoner to accompany him, and they two walked out together, being to
      all appearance willing companions and in perfect friendliness with one
      another. The queen herself watched them go from the windows of her
      apartment, and noticed that Bernenstein rode half a pace behind, and that
      his free hand rested on the revolver by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now well on in the morning, and the risk of Rudolf&rsquo;s sojourn in the
      castle grew greater with every moment. Yet he was resolved to see the
      queen before he went. This interview presented no great difficulties,
      since her Majesty was in the habit of coming to the constable&rsquo;s room to
      take his advice or to consult with him. The hardest task was to contrive
      afterwards a free and unnoticed escape for Mr. Rassendyll. To meet this
      necessity, the constable issued orders that the company of guards which
      garrisoned the castle should parade at one o&rsquo;clock in the park, and that
      the servants should all, after their dinner, be granted permission to
      watch the manoeuvres. By this means he counted on drawing off any curious
      eyes and allowing Rudolf to reach the forest unobserved. They appointed a
      rendezvous in a handy and sheltered spot; the one thing which they were
      compelled to trust to fortune was Rudolf&rsquo;s success in evading chance
      encounters while he waited. Mr. Rassendyll himself was confident of his
      ability to conceal his presence, or, if need were, so to hide his face
      that no strange tale of the king being seen wandering, alone and
      beardless, should reach the ears of the castle or the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Sapt was making his arrangements, Queen Flavia came to the room
      where Rudolf Rassendyll was. It was then nearing twelve, and young
      Bernenstein had been gone half an hour. Sapt attended her to the door, set
      a sentry at the end of the passage with orders that her Majesty should on
      no pretence be disturbed, promised her very audibly to return as soon as
      he possibly could, and respectfully closed the door after she had entered.
      The constable was well aware of the value in a secret business of doing
      openly all that can safely be done with openness.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of what passed at that interview I do not know, but a part Queen
      Flavia herself told to me, or rather to Helga, my wife; for although it
      was meant to reach my ear, yet to me, a man, she would not disclose it
      directly. First she learnt from Mr. Rassendyll the plans that had been
      made, and, although she trembled at the danger that he must run in meeting
      Rupert of Hentzau, she had such love of him and such a trust in his powers
      that she seemed to doubt little of his success. But she began to reproach
      herself for having brought him into this peril by writing her letter. At
      this he took from his pocket the copy that Rischenheim had carried. He had
      found time to read it, and now before her eyes he kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I as many lives as there are words, my queen,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;for
      each word I would gladly give a life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Rudolf, but you&rsquo;ve only one life, and that more mine than yours. Did
      you think we should ever meet again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said he; and now they were standing opposite one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I knew,&rdquo; she said, her eyes shining brightly; &ldquo;I knew always that we
      should meet once more. Not how, nor where, but just that we should. So I
      lived, Rudolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I lived through it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand, knowing what that phrase meant and must mean for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it last forever?&rdquo; she asked, suddenly gripping his hand tightly. But
      a moment later she went on: &ldquo;No, no, I mustn&rsquo;t make you unhappy, Rudolf.
      I&rsquo;m half glad I wrote the letter, and half glad they stole it. It&rsquo;s so
      sweet to have you fighting for me, for me only this time, Rudolf&mdash;not
      for the king, for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet indeed, my dearest lady. Don&rsquo;t be afraid: we shall win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will win, yes. And then you&rsquo;ll go?&rdquo; And, dropping his hand, she
      covered her face with hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t kiss your face,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but your hands I may kiss,&rdquo; and he
      kissed her hands as they were pressed against her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wear my ring,&rdquo; she murmured through her fingers, &ldquo;always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he said, with a little laugh of wonder at her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is&mdash;no one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My queen!&rdquo; said he, laughing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I knew really, Rudolf, I knew really,&rdquo; and now her hands flew out
      towards him, imploring his pardon. Then she began to speak quickly:
      &ldquo;Rudolf, last night I had a dream about you, a strange dream. I seemed to
      be in Strelsau, and all the people were talking about the king. It was you
      they meant; you were the king. At last you were the king, and I was your
      queen. But I could see you only very dimly; you were somewhere, but I
      could not make out where; just sometimes your face came. Then I tried to
      tell you that you were king&mdash;yes, and Colonel Sapt and Fritz tried to
      tell you; the people, too, called out that you were king. What did it
      mean? But your face, when I saw it, was unmoved, and very pale, and you
      seemed not to hear what we said, not even what I said. It almost seemed as
      if you were dead, and yet king. Ah, you mustn&rsquo;t die, even to be king,&rdquo; and
      she laid a hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; said he gently, &ldquo;in dreams desires and fears blend in
      strange visions, so I seemed to you to be both a king and a dead man; but
      I&rsquo;m not a king, and I am a very healthy fellow. Yet a thousand thanks to
      my dearest queen for dreaming of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but what could it mean?&rdquo; she asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean when I dream always of you, except that I always love
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it only that?&rdquo; she said, still unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      What more passed between them I do not know. I think that the queen told
      my wife more, but women will sometimes keep women&rsquo;s secrets even from
      their husbands; though they love us, yet we are always in some sort the
      common enemy, against whom they join hands. Well, I would not look too far
      into such secrets, for to know must be, I suppose, to blame, and who is
      himself so blameless that in such a case he would be free with his
      censures?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet much cannot have passed, for almost close on their talk about the
      dream came Colonel Sapt, saying that the guards were in line, and all the
      women streamed out to watch them, while the men followed, lest the gay
      uniforms should make them forgotten. Certainly a quiet fell over the old
      castle, that only the constable&rsquo;s curt tones broke, as he bade Rudolf come
      by the back way to the stables and mount his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to lose,&rdquo; said Sapt, and his eye seemed to grudge the
      queen even one more word with the man she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rudolf was not to be hurried into leaving her in such a fashion. He
      clapped the constable on the shoulder, laughing, and bidding him think of
      what he would for a moment; then he went again to the queen and would have
      knelt before her, but that she would not suffer, and they stood with hands
      locked. Then suddenly she drew him to her and kissed his forehead, saying:
      &ldquo;God go with you, Rudolf my knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus she turned away, letting him go. He walked towards the door; but a
      sound arrested his steps, and he waited in the middle of the room, his
      eyes on the door. Old Sapt flew to the threshold, his sword half-way out
      of its sheath. There was a step coming down the passage, and the feet
      stopped outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the king?&rdquo; whispered Rudolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not the king,&rdquo; came in unhesitating certainty from Queen Flavia.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited: a low knock sounded on the door. Still for a moment they
      waited. The knock was repeated urgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must open,&rdquo; said Sapt. &ldquo;Behind the curtain with you, Rudolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen sat down, and Sapt piled a heap of papers before her, that it
      might seem as though he and she transacted business. But his precautions
      were interrupted by a hoarse, eager, low cry from outside, &ldquo;Quick! in
      God&rsquo;s name, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They knew the voice for Bernenstein&rsquo;s. The queen sprang up, Rudolf came
      out, Sapt turned the key. The lieutenant entered, hurried, breathless,
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has got away?&rdquo; cried Rudolf, guessing in a moment the misfortune that
      had brought Bernenstein back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s got away. Just as we left the town and reached the open road
      towards Tarlenheim, he said, &lsquo;Are we going to walk all the way? I was not
      loath to go quicker, and we broke into a trot. But I&mdash;ah, what a
      pestilent fool I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that&mdash;go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I was thinking of him and my task, and having a bullet ready for
      him, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of everything except your horse?&rdquo; guessed Sapt, with a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and the horse pecked and stumbled, and I fell forward on his neck. I
      put out my arm to recover myself, and&mdash;I jerked my revolver on to the
      ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he saw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He saw, curse him. For a second he waited; then he smiled, and turned,
      and dug his spurs in and was off, straight across country towards
      Strelsau. Well, I was off my horse in a moment, and I fired three times
      after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hit?&rdquo; asked Rudolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. He shifted the reins from one hand to the other and wrung his
      arm. I mounted and made after him, but his horse was better than mine and
      he gained ground. We began to meet people, too, and I didn&rsquo;t dare to fire
      again. So I left him and rode here to tell you. Never employ me again,
      Constable, so long as you live,&rdquo; and the young man&rsquo;s face was twisted with
      misery and shame, as, forgetting the queen&rsquo;s presence, he sank
      despondently into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt took no notice of his self-reproaches. But Rudolf went and laid a
      hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an accident,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No blame to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen rose and walked towards him; Bernenstein sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is not success but effort that should gain thanks,&rdquo;
       and she held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he was young; I do not laugh at the sob that escaped his lips as he
      turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me try something else!&rdquo; he implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Rassendyll,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll do my pleasure by employing this
      gentleman in my further service. I am already deep in his debt, and would
      be deeper.&rdquo; There was a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; asked Colonel Sapt. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to
      Strelsau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll stop Rupert,&rdquo; mused Mr. Rassendyll. &ldquo;He may or he mayn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s odds that he will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must provide for both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt and Rudolf looked at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be here!&rdquo; asked Rudolf of the constable. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go to
      Strelsau.&rdquo; His smile broke out. &ldquo;That is, if Bernenstein&rsquo;ll lend me a
      hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen made no sound; but she came and laid her hand on his arm. He
      looked at her, smiling still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go to Strelsau,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll find Rupert, ay, and
      Rischenheim too, if they&rsquo;re in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me with you,&rdquo; cried Bernenstein eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf glanced at Sapt. The constable shook his head. Bernenstein&rsquo;s face
      fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, boy,&rdquo; said old Sapt, half in kindness, half in impatience.
      &ldquo;We want you here. Suppose Rupert comes here with Rischenheim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea was new, but the event was by no means unlikely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be here, Constable,&rdquo; urged Bernenstein, &ldquo;and Fritz von
      Tarlenheim will arrive in an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, young man,&rdquo; said Sapt, nodding his head; &ldquo;but when I fight Rupert of
      Hentzau, I like to have a man to spare,&rdquo; and he grinned broadly, being no
      whit afraid of what Bernenstein might think of his courage. &ldquo;Now go and
      get him a hat,&rdquo; he added, and the lieutenant ran off on the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the queen cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sending Rudolf alone, then&mdash;alone against two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam, if I may command the campaign,&rdquo; said Sapt. &ldquo;I take it he
      should be equal to the task.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not know the feelings of the queen&rsquo;s heart. She dashed her hand
      across her eyes, and turned in mute entreaty to Rudolf Rassendyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t spare Bernenstein, and I mustn&rsquo;t
      stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said no more. Rudolf walked across to Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me to the stables. Is the horse good? I daren&rsquo;t take the train. Ah,
      here&rsquo;s the lieutenant and the hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horse&rsquo;ll get you there to-night,&rdquo; said Sapt. &ldquo;Come along.
      Bernenstein, stay with the queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the threshold Rudolf paused, and, turning his head, glanced once at
      Queen Flavia, who stood still as a statue, watching him go. Then he
      followed the constable, who brought him where the horse was. Sapt&rsquo;s
      devices for securing freedom from observation had served well, and Rudolf
      mounted unmolested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hat doesn&rsquo;t fit very well,&rdquo; said Rudolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a crown better, eh?&rdquo; suggested the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf laughed as he asked, &ldquo;Well, what are my orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride round by the moat to the road at the back; then through the forest
      to Hofbau; you know your way after that. You mustn&rsquo;t reach Strelsau till
      it&rsquo;s dark. Then, if you want a shelter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Fritz von Tarlenheim&rsquo;s, yes! From there I shall go straight to the
      address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay. And&mdash;Rudolf!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make an end of him this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please God. But if he goes to the lodge? He will, unless Rischenheim
      stops him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there in case&mdash;but I think Rischenheim will stop him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he comes here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Bernenstein will die before he suffers him to reach the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sapt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be kind to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless the man, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a swift canter Rudolf darted round the drive that led from the stables,
      by the moat, to the old forest road behind; five minutes brought him
      within the shelter of the trees, and he rode on confidently, meeting
      nobody, save here and there a yokel, who, seeing a man ride hard with his
      head averted, took no more notice of him than to wish that he himself
      could ride abroad instead of being bound to work. Thus Rudolf Rassendyll
      set out again for the walls of Strelsau, through the forest of Zenda. And
      ahead of him, with an hour&rsquo;s start, galloped the Count of
      Luzau-Rischenheim, again a man, and a man with resolution, resentment, and
      revenge in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game was afoot now; who could tell the issue of it?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE MESSAGE OF SIMON THE HUNTSMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      I RECEIVED the telegram sent to me by the Constable of Zenda at my own
      house in Strelsau about one o&rsquo;clock. It is needless to say that I made
      immediate preparations to obey his summons. My wife indeed protested&mdash;and
      I must admit with some show of reason&mdash;that I was unfit to endure
      further fatigues, and that my bed was the only proper place for me. I
      could not listen; and James, Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s servant, being informed of
      the summons, was at my elbow with a card of the trains from Strelsau to
      Zenda, without waiting for any order from me. I had talked to this man in
      the course of our journey, and discovered that he had been in the service
      of Lord Topham, formerly British Ambassador to the Court of Ruritania. How
      far he was acquainted with the secrets of his present master, I did not
      know, but his familiarity with the city and the country made him of great
      use to me. We discovered, to our annoyance, that no train left till four
      o&rsquo;clock, and then only a slow one; the result was that we could not arrive
      at the castle till past six o&rsquo;clock. This hour was not absolutely too
      late, but I was of course eager to be on the scene of action as early as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better see if you can get a special, my lord,&rdquo; James suggested;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run on to the station and arrange about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I agreed. Since I was known to be often employed in the king&rsquo;s service, I
      could take a special train without exciting remark. James set out, and
      about a quarter of an hour later I got into my carriage to drive to the
      station. Just as the horses were about to start, however, the butler
      approached me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, my lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but Bauer didn&rsquo;t return with your
      lordship. Is he coming back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Bauer was grossly impertinent on the journey, and I
      dismissed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those foreign men are never to be trusted, my lord. And your lordship&rsquo;s
      bag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, hasn&rsquo;t it come?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I told him to send it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not arrived, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can the rogue have stolen it?&rdquo; I exclaimed indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your lordship wishes it, I will mention the matter to the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I appeared to consider this proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I come back,&rdquo; I ended by saying. &ldquo;The bag may come, and I have
      no reason to doubt the fellow&rsquo;s honesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, I thought, would be the end of my connection with Master Bauer. He
      had served Rupert&rsquo;s turn, and would now disappear from the scene. Indeed
      it may be that Rupert would have liked to dispense with further aid from
      him; but he had few whom he could trust, and was compelled to employ those
      few more than once. At any rate he had not done with Bauer, and I very
      soon received proof of the fact. My house is a couple of miles from the
      station, and we have to pass through a considerable part of the old town,
      where the streets are narrow and tortuous and progress necessarily slow.
      We had just entered the Konigstrasse (and it must be remembered that I had
      at that time no reason for attaching any special significance to this
      locality), and were waiting impatiently for a heavy dray to move out of
      our path, when my coachman, who had overheard the butler&rsquo;s conversation
      with me, leant down from his box with an air of lively excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Bauer&mdash;there, passing the butcher&rsquo;s
      shop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sprang up in the carriage; the man&rsquo;s back was towards me, and he was
      threading his way through the people with a quick, stealthy tread. I
      believe he must have seen me, and was slinking away as fast as he could. I
      was not sure of him, but the coachman banished my doubt by saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      Bauer&mdash;it&rsquo;s certainly Bauer, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hardly stayed to form a resolution. If I could catch this fellow or even
      see where he went, a most important clue as to Rupert&rsquo;s doings and
      whereabouts might be put into my hand. I leapt out of the carriage,
      bidding the man wait, and at once started in pursuit of my former servant.
      I heard the coachman laugh: he thought, no doubt, that anxiety for the
      missing bag inspired such eager haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The numbers of the houses in the Konigstrasse begin, as anybody familiar
      with Strelsau will remember, at the end adjoining the station. The street
      being a long one, intersecting almost the entire length of the old town, I
      was, when I set out after Bauer, opposite number 300 or thereabouts, and
      distant nearly three-quarters of a mile from that important number
      nineteen, towards which Bauer was hurrying like a rabbit to its burrow. I
      knew nothing and thought nothing of where he was going; to me nineteen was
      no more than eighteen or twenty; my only desire was to overtake him. I had
      no clear idea of what I meant to do when I caught him, but I had some hazy
      notion of intimidating him into giving up his secret by the threat of an
      accusation of theft. In fact, he had stolen my bag. After him I went; and
      he knew that I was after him. I saw him turn his face over his shoulder,
      and then bustle on faster. Neither of us, pursued or pursuer, dared quite
      to run; as it was, our eager strides and our carelessness of collisions
      created more than enough attention. But I had one advantage. Most folk in
      Strelsau knew me, and many got out of my way who were by no means inclined
      to pay a like civility to Bauer. Thus I began to gain on him, in spite of
      his haste; I had started fifty yards behind, but as we neared the end of
      the street and saw the station ahead of us, not more than twenty separated
      me from him. Then an annoying thing happened. I ran full into a stout old
      gentleman; Bauer had run into him before, and he was standing, as people
      will, staring in resentful astonishment at his first assailant&rsquo;s
      retreating figure. The second collision immensely increased his vexation;
      for me it had yet worse consequences; for when I disentangled myself,
      Bauer was gone! There was not a sign of him; I looked up: the number of
      the house above me was twenty-three; but the door was shut. I walked on a
      few paces, past twenty-two, past twenty-one&mdash;and up to nineteen.
      Nineteen was an old house, with a dirty, dilapidated front and an air
      almost dissipated. It was a shop where provisions of the cheaper sort were
      on view in the window, things that one has never eaten but has heard of
      people eating. The shop-door stood open, but there was nothing to connect
      Bauer with the house. Muttering an oath in my exasperation, I was about to
      pass on, when an old woman put her head out of the door and looked round.
      I was full in front of her. I am sure that the old woman started slightly,
      and I think that I did. For I knew her and she knew me. She was old Mother
      Holf, one of whose sons, Johann, had betrayed to us the secret of the
      dungeon at Zenda, while the other had died by Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s hand by the
      side of the great pipe that masked the king&rsquo;s window. Her presence might
      mean nothing, yet it seemed at once to connect the house with the secret
      of the past and the crisis of the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recovered herself in a moment, and curtseyed to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mother Holf,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how long is it since you set up shop in
      Strelsau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About six months, my lord,&rdquo; she answered, with a composed air and arms
      akimbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not come across you before,&rdquo; said I, looking keenly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a poor little shop as mine would not be likely to secure your
      lordship&rsquo;s patronage,&rdquo; she answered, in a humility that seemed only half
      genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up at the windows. They were all closed and had their wooden
      lattices shut. The house was devoid of any signs of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a good house here, mother, though it wants a splash of paint,&rdquo;
       said I. &ldquo;Do you live all alone in it with your daughter?&rdquo; For Max was dead
      and Johann abroad, and the old woman had, as far as I knew, no other
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes; sometimes not,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I let lodgings to single men when I
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul, worse luck, my lord.&rdquo; Then I shot an arrow at a venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who came in just now, then, was he only a customer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish a customer had come in, but there has been nobody,&rdquo; she replied in
      surprised tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked full in her eyes; she met mine with a blinking imperturbability.
      There is no face so inscrutable as a clever old woman&rsquo;s when she is on her
      guard. And her fat body barred the entrance; I could not so much as see
      inside, while the window, choked full with pigs&rsquo; trotters and such-like
      dainties, helped me very little. If the fox were there, he had got to
      earth and I could not dig him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment I saw James approaching hurriedly. He was looking up the
      street, no doubt seeking my carriage and chafing at its delay. An instant
      later he saw me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your train will be ready in five minutes; if it
      doesn&rsquo;t start then, the line must be closed for another half-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I perceived a faint smile on the old woman&rsquo;s face. I was sure then that I
      was on the track of Bauer, and probably of more than Bauer. But my first
      duty was to obey orders and get to Zenda. Besides, I could not force my
      way in, there in open daylight, without a scandal that would have set all
      the long ears in Strelsau aprick. I turned away reluctantly. I did not
      even know for certain that Bauer was within, and thus had no information
      of value to carry with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your lordship would kindly recommend me&mdash;&rdquo; said the old hag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll recommend you,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll recommend you to be careful whom
      you take for lodgers. There are queer fish about, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take the money beforehand,&rdquo; she retorted with a grin; and I was as sure
      that she was in the plot as of my own existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to be done; James&rsquo;s face urged me towards the station. I
      turned away. But at this instant a loud, merry laugh sounded from inside
      the house. I started, and this time violently. The old woman&rsquo;s brow
      contracted in a frown, and her lips twitched for a moment; then her face
      regained its composure; but I knew the laugh, and she must have guessed
      that I knew it. Instantly I tried to appear as though I had noticed
      nothing. I nodded to her carelessly, and bidding James follow me, set out
      for the station. But as we reached the platform, I laid my hand on his
      shoulder, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count of Hentzau is in that house, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me without surprise; he was as hard to stir to wonder as old
      Sapt himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir. Shall I stay and watch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, come with me,&rdquo; I answered. To tell the truth, I thought that to leave
      him alone in Strelsau to watch that house was in all likelihood to sign
      his death warrant, and I shrank from imposing the duty on him. Rudolf
      might send him if he would; I dared not. So we got into our train, and I
      suppose that my coachman, when he had looked long enough for me, went
      home. I forgot to ask him afterwards. Very likely he thought it a fine
      joke to see his master hunting a truant servant and a truant bag through
      the streets in broad daylight. Had he known the truth, he would have been
      as interested, though, maybe, less amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arrived at the town of Zenda at half-past three, and was in the castle
      before four. I may pass over the most kind and gracious words with which
      the queen received me. Every sight of her face and every sound of her
      voice bound a man closer to her service, and now she made me feel that I
      was a poor fellow to have lost her letter and yet to be alive. But she
      would hear nothing of such talk, choosing rather to praise the little I
      had done than to blame the great thing in which I had failed. Dismissed
      from her presence, I flew open-mouthed to Sapt. I found him in his room
      with Bernenstein, and had the satisfaction of learning that my news of
      Rupert&rsquo;s whereabouts was confirmed by his information. I was also made
      acquainted with all that had been done, even as I have already related it,
      from the first successful trick played on Rischenheim to the moment of his
      unfortunate escape. But my face grew long and apprehensive when I heard
      that Rudolf Rassendyll had gone alone to Strelsau to put his head in that
      lion&rsquo;s mouth in the Konigstrasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be three of them there&mdash;Rupert, Rischenheim, and my
      rascal Bauer,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to Rupert, we don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sapt reminded me. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be there if
      Rischenheim arrives in time to tell him the truth. But we have also to be
      ready for him here, and at the hunting lodge. Well, we&rsquo;re ready for him
      wherever he is: Rudolf will be in Strelsau, you and I will ride to the
      lodge, and Bernenstein will be here with the queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one here?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but a good one,&rdquo; said the constable, clapping Bernenstein on the
      shoulder. &ldquo;We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be gone above four hours, and those while the king
      is safe in his bed. Bernenstein has only to refuse access to him, and
      stand to that with his life till we come back. You&rsquo;re equal to that, eh,
      Lieutenant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am, by nature, a cautious man, and prone to look at the dark side of
      every prospect and the risks of every enterprise; but I could not see what
      better dispositions were possible against the attack that threatened us.
      Yet I was sorely uneasy concerning Mr. Rassendyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, after all our stir and runnings to and fro, came an hour or two of
      peace. We employed the time in having a good meal, and it was past five
      when, our repast finished, we sat back in our chairs enjoying cigars.
      James had waited on us, quietly usurping the office of the constable&rsquo;s own
      servant, and thus we had been able to talk freely. The man&rsquo;s calm
      confidence in his master and his master&rsquo;s fortune also went far to comfort
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king should be back soon,&rdquo; said Sapt at last, with a glance at his
      big, old-fashioned silver watch. &ldquo;Thank God, he&rsquo;ll be too tired to sit up
      long. We shall be free by nine o&rsquo;clock, Fritz. I wish young Rupert would
      come to the lodge!&rdquo; And the colonel&rsquo;s face expressed a lively pleasure at
      the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six o&rsquo;clock struck, and the king did not appear. A few moments later, a
      message came from the queen, requesting our presence on the terrace in
      front of the chateau. The place commanded a view of the road by which the
      king would ride back, and we found the queen walking restlessly up and
      down, considerably disquieted by the lateness of his return. In such a
      position as ours, every unusual or unforeseen incident magnifies its
      possible meaning, and invests itself with a sinister importance which
      would at ordinary times seem absurd. We three shared the queen&rsquo;s feelings,
      and forgetting the many chances of the chase, any one of which would amply
      account for the king&rsquo;s delay, fell to speculating on remote possibilities
      of disaster. He might have met Rischenheim&mdash;though they had ridden in
      opposite directions; Rupert might have intercepted him&mdash;though no
      means could have brought Rupert to the forest so early. Our fears defeated
      common sense, and our conjectures outran possibility. Sapt was the first
      to recover from this foolish mood, and he rated us soundly, not sparing
      even the queen herself. With a laugh we regained some of our equanimity,
      and felt rather ashamed of our weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still it&rsquo;s strange that he doesn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; murmured the queen, shading her
      eyes with her hand, and looking along the road to where the dark masses of
      the forest trees bounded our view. It was already dusk, but not so dark
      but that we could have seen the king&rsquo;s party as soon as it came into the
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the king&rsquo;s delay seemed strange at six, it was stranger at seven, and
      by eight most strange. We had long since ceased to talk lightly; by now we
      had lapsed into silence. Sapt&rsquo;s scoldings had died away. The queen,
      wrapped in her furs (for it was very cold), sat sometimes on a seat, but
      oftener paced restlessly to and fro. Evening had fallen. We did not know
      what to do, nor even whether we ought to do anything. Sapt would not own
      to sharing our worst apprehensions, but his gloomy silence in face of our
      surmises witnessed that he was in his heart as disturbed as we were. For
      my part I had come to the end of my endurance, and I cried, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s
      sake, let&rsquo;s act! Shall I go and seek him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A needle in a bundle of hay,&rdquo; said Sapt with a shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this instant my ear caught the sound of horses cantering on the
      road from the forest; at the same moment Bernenstein cried, &ldquo;Here they
      come!&rdquo; The queen paused, and we gathered round her. The horse-hoofs came
      nearer. Now we made out the figures of three men: they were the king&rsquo;s
      huntsmen, and they rode along merrily, singing a hunting chorus. The sound
      of it brought relief to us; so far at least there was no disaster. But why
      was not the king with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king is probably tired, and is following more slowly, madam,&rdquo;
       suggested Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      This explanation seemed very probable, and the lieutenant and I, as ready
      to be hopeful on slight grounds as fearful on small provocation, joyfully
      accepted it. Sapt, less easily turned to either mood, said, &ldquo;Ay, but let
      us hear,&rdquo; and raising his voice, called to the huntsmen, who had now
      arrived in the avenue. One of them, the king&rsquo;s chief huntsman Simon,
      gorgeous in his uniform of green and gold, came swaggering along, and
      bowed low to the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Simon, where is the king?&rdquo; she asked, trying to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king, madam, has sent a message by me to your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, deliver it to me, Simon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, madam. The king has enjoyed fine sport; and, indeed, madam, if I
      may say so for myself, a better run.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say, friend Simon,&rdquo; interrupted the constable, tapping him on the
      shoulder, &ldquo;anything you like for yourself, but, as a matter of etiquette,
      the king&rsquo;s message should come first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ay, Constable,&rdquo; said Simon. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always so down on a man, aren&rsquo;t
      you? Well, then, madam, the king has enjoyed fine sport. For we started a
      boar at eleven, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the king&rsquo;s message, Simon?&rdquo; asked the queen, smiling in genuine
      amusement, but impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, madam, not precisely his majesty&rsquo;s message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then get to it, man, in Heaven&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; growled Sapt testily. For here
      were we four (the queen, too, one of us!) on tenterhooks, while the fool
      boasted about the sport that he had shown the king. For every boar in the
      forest Simon took as much credit as though he, and not Almighty God, had
      made the animal. It is the way with such fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon became a little confused under the combined influence of his own
      seductive memories and Sapt&rsquo;s brusque exhortations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was saying, madam,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;the boar led us a long way, but at
      last the hounds pulled him down, and his majesty himself gave the coup de
      grace. Well, then it was very late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no earlier now,&rdquo; grumbled the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the king, although indeed, madam, his majesty was so gracious as to
      say that no huntsman whom his majesty had ever had, had given his majesty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help us!&rdquo; groaned the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon shot an apprehensive apologetic glance at Colonel Sapt. The
      constable was frowning ferociously. In spite of the serious matters in
      hand I could not forbear a smile, while young Bernenstein broke into an
      audible laugh, which he tried to smother with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the king was very tired, Simon?&rdquo; said the queen, at once encouraging
      him and bringing him back to the point with a woman&rsquo;s skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam, the king was very tired; and as we chanced to kill near the
      hunting-lodge&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not know whether Simon noticed any change in the manner of his
      audience. But the queen looked up with parted lips, and I believe that we
      three all drew a step nearer him. Sapt did not interrupt this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam, the king was very tired, and as we chanced to kill near the
      hunting-lodge, the king bade us carry our quarry there, and come back to
      dress it to-morrow; so we obeyed, and here we are&mdash;that is, except
      Herbert, my brother, who stayed with the king by his majesty&rsquo;s orders.
      Because, madam, Herbert is a handy fellow, and my good mother taught him
      to cook a steak and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stayed where with the king?&rdquo; roared Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, at the hunting-lodge, Constable. The king stays there to-night, and
      will ride back tomorrow morning with Herbert. That, madam, is the king&rsquo;s
      message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had come to it at last, and it was something to come to. Simon gazed
      from face to face. I saw him, and I understood at once that our feelings
      must be speaking too plainly. So I took on myself to dismiss him, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Simon, thanks: we understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to the queen; she roused herself, and added her thanks to mine.
      Simon withdrew, looking still a little puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we were left alone, there was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Then I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose Rupert&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Constable of Zenda broke in with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my life,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how things fall out! We say he will go to the
      hunting-lodge, and&mdash;he goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Rupert goes&mdash;if Rischenheim doesn&rsquo;t stop him!&rdquo; I urged again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen rose from her seat and stretched out her hands towards us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, my letter!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt wasted no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernenstein,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you stay here as we arranged. Nothing is altered.
      Horses for Fritz and myself in five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernenstein turned and shot like an arrow along the terrace towards the
      stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is altered, madam,&rdquo; said Sapt, &ldquo;except that we must be there
      before Count Rupert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at my watch. It was twenty minutes past nine. Simon&rsquo;s cursed
      chatter had lost a quarter of an hour. I opened my lips to speak. A glance
      from Sapt&rsquo;s eyes told me that he discerned what I was about to say. I was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be in time?&rdquo; asked the queen, with clasped hands and frightened
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly, madam,&rdquo; returned Sapt with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t let him reach the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, madam,&rdquo; said Sapt with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From my heart, gentlemen,&rdquo; she said in a trembling voice, &ldquo;from my heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the horses,&rdquo; cried Sapt. He snatched her hand, brushed it with
      his grizzly moustache, and&mdash;well, I am not sure I heard, and I can
      hardly believe what I think I heard. But I will set it down for what it is
      worth. I think he said, &ldquo;Bless your sweet face, we&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; At any rate
      she drew back with a little cry of surprise, and I saw the tears standing
      in her eyes. I kissed her hand also; then we mounted, and we started, and
      we rode, as if the devil were behind us, for the hunting-lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I turned once to watch her standing on the terrace, with young
      Bernenstein&rsquo;s tall figure beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we be in time?&rdquo; said I. It was what I had meant to say before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not, but, by God, we&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Colonel Sapt. And I knew why
      he had not let me speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a sound behind us of a horse at the gallop. Our heads
      flew round in the ready apprehension of men on a perilous errand. The
      hoofs drew near, for the unknown rode with reckless haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had best see what it is,&rdquo; said the constable, pulling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second more, and the horseman was beside us. Sapt swore an oath, half in
      amusement, half in vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, is it you, James?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Rudolf Rassendyll&rsquo;s servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do you want?&rdquo; asked Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to attend on the Count von Tarlenheim, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not give you any orders, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. But Mr. Rassendyll told me not to leave you, unless you sent me
      away. So I made haste to follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Sapt cried: &ldquo;Deuce take it, what horse is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best in the stables, so far as I could see, sir. I was afraid of not
      overtaking you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt tugged his moustaches, scowled, but finally laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged for your compliment,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The horse is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir?&rdquo; said James with respectful interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment we were all silent. Then Sapt laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; said he, and the three of us dashed into the forest.

      CHAPTER VIII. THE TEMPER OF BORIS THE HOUND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Looking back now, in the light of the information I have gathered, I am
      able to trace very clearly, and almost hour by hour, the events of this
      day, and to understand how chance, laying hold of our cunning plan and
      mocking our wiliness, twisted and turned our device to a predetermined but
      undreamt-of issue, of which we were most guiltless in thought or intent.
      Had the king not gone to the hunting-lodge, our design would have found
      the fulfilment we looked for; had Rischenheim succeeded in warning Rupert
      of Hentzau, we should have stood where we were. Fate or fortune would have
      it otherwise. The king, being weary, went to the lodge, and Rischenheim
      failed in warning his cousin. It was a narrow failure, for Rupert, as his
      laugh told me, was in the house in the Konigstrasse when I set out from
      Strelsau, and Rischenheim arrived there at half past four. He had taken
      the train at a roadside station, and thus easily outstripped Mr.
      Rassendyll, who, not daring to show his face, was forced to ride all the
      way and enter the city under cover of night. But Rischenheim had not dared
      to send a warning, for he knew that we were in possession of the address
      and did not know what steps we might have taken to intercept messages.
      Therefore he was obliged to carry the news himself; when he came his man
      was gone. Indeed Rupert must have left the house almost immediately after
      I was safe away from the city. He was determined to be in good time for
      his appointment; his only enemies were not in Strelsau; there was no
      warrant on which he could be apprehended; and, although his connection
      with Black Michael was a matter of popular gossip, he felt himself safe
      from arrest by virtue of the secret that protected him. Accordingly he
      walked out of the house, went to the station, took his ticket to Hofbau,
      and, traveling by the four o&rsquo;clock train, reached his destination about
      half-past five. He must have passed the train in which Rischenheim
      traveled; the first news the latter had of his departure was from a porter
      at the station, who, having recognized the Count of Hentzau, ventured to
      congratulate Rischenheim on his cousin&rsquo;s return. Rischenheim made no
      answer, but hurried in great agitation to the house in the Konigstrasse,
      where the old woman Holf confirmed the tidings. Then he passed through a
      period of great irresolution. Loyalty to Rupert urged that he should
      follow him and share the perils into which his cousin was hastening. But
      caution whispered that he was not irrevocably committed, that nothing
      overt yet connected him with Rupert&rsquo;s schemes, and that we who knew the
      truth should be well content to purchase his silence as to the trick we
      had played by granting him immunity. His fears won the day, and, like the
      irresolute man he was, he determined to wait in Strelsau till he heard the
      issue of the meeting at the lodge. If Rupert were disposed of there, he
      had something to offer us in return for peace; if his cousin escaped, he
      would be in the Konigstrasse, prepared to second the further plans of the
      desperate adventurer. In any event his skin was safe, and I presume to
      think that this weighed a little with him; for excuse he had the wound
      which Bernenstein had given him, and which rendered his right arm entirely
      useless; had he gone then, he would have been a most inefficient ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all this we, as we rode through the forest, knew nothing. We might
      guess, conjecture, hope, or fear; but our certain knowledge stopped with
      Rischenheim&rsquo;s start for the capital and Rupert&rsquo;s presence there at three
      o&rsquo;clock. The pair might have met or might have missed. We had to act as
      though they had missed and Rupert were gone to meet the king. But we were
      late. The consciousness of that pressed upon us, although we evaded
      further mention of it; it made us spur and drive our horses as quickly,
      ay, and a little more quickly, than safety allowed. Once James&rsquo;s horse
      stumbled in the darkness and its rider was thrown; more than once a low
      bough hanging over the path nearly swept me, dead or stunned, from my
      seat. Sapt paid no attention to these mishaps or threatened mishaps. He
      had taken the lead, and, sitting well down in his saddle, rode ahead,
      turning neither to right nor left, never slackening his pace, sparing
      neither himself nor his beast. James and I were side by side behind him.
      We rode in silence, finding nothing to say to one another. My mind was
      full of a picture&mdash;the picture of Rupert with his easy smile handing
      to the king the queen&rsquo;s letter. For the hour of the rendezvous was past.
      If that image had been translated into reality, what must we do? To kill
      Rupert would satisfy revenge, but of what other avail would it be when the
      king had read the letter? I am ashamed to say that I found myself girding
      at Mr. Rassendyll for happening on a plan which the course of events had
      turned into a trap for ourselves and not for Rupert of Hentzau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Sapt, turning his head for the first time, pointed in front of
      him. The lodge was before us; we saw it looming dimly a quarter of a mile
      off. Sapt reined in his horse, and we followed his example. All
      dismounted, we tied our horses to trees and went forward at a quick,
      silent walk. Our idea was that Sapt should enter on pretext of having been
      sent by the queen to attend to her husband&rsquo;s comfort and arrange for his
      return without further fatigue next day. If Rupert had come and gone, the
      king&rsquo;s demeanor would probably betray the fact; if he had not yet come, I
      and James, patrolling outside, would bar his passage. There was a third
      possibility; he might be even now with the king. Our course in such a case
      we left unsettled; so far as I had any plan, it was to kill Rupert and to
      convince the king that the letter was a forgery&mdash;a desperate hope, so
      desperate that we turned our eyes away from the possibility which would
      make it our only resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were now very near the hunting-lodge, being about forty yards from the
      front of it. All at once Sapt threw himself on his stomach on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a match,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      James struck a light, and, the night being still, the flame burnt
      brightly: it showed us the mark of a horse&rsquo;s hoof, apparently quite fresh,
      and leading away from the lodge. We rose and went on, following the tracks
      by the aid of more matches till we reached a tree twenty yards from the
      door. Here the hoof marks ceased; but beyond there was a double track of
      human feet in the soft black earth; a man had gone thence to the house and
      returned from the house thither. On the right of the tree were more
      hoof-marks, leading up to it and then ceasing. A man had ridden up from
      the right, dismounted, gone on foot to the house, returned to the tree,
      remounted, and ridden away along the track by which we had approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be somebody else,&rdquo; said I; but I do not think that we any of us
      doubted in our hearts that the tracks were made by the coming of Hentzau.
      Then the king had the letter; the mischief was done. We were too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet we did not hesitate. Since disaster had come, it must be faced. Mr.
      Rassendyll&rsquo;s servant and I followed the constable of Zenda up to the door,
      or within a few feet of it. Here Sapt, who was in uniform, loosened his
      sword in its sheath; James and I looked to our revolvers. There were no
      lights visible in the lodge; the door was shut; everything was still. Sapt
      knocked softly with his knuckles, but there was no answer from within. He
      laid hold of the handle and turned it; the door opened, and the passage
      lay dark and apparently empty before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stay here, as we arranged,&rdquo; whispered the colonel. &ldquo;Give me the
      matches, and I&rsquo;ll go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      James handed him the box of matches, and he crossed the threshold. For a
      yard or two we saw him plainly, then his figure grew dim and indistinct. I
      heard nothing except my own hard breathing. But in a moment there was
      another sound&mdash;a muffled exclamation, and a noise of a man stumbling;
      a sword, too, clattered on the stones of the passage. We looked at one
      another; the noise did not produce any answering stir in the house; then
      came the sharp little explosion of a match struck on its box; next we
      heard Sapt raising himself, his scabbard scraping along the stones; his
      footsteps came towards us, and in a second he appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fell,&rdquo; said Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see. James, stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed the constable for the distance of eight or ten feet along the
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a lamp anywhere?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can see enough with a match,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Here, this is what I fell
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even before the match was struck I saw a dark body lying across the
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dead man?&rdquo; I guessed instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Sapt, striking a light: &ldquo;a dead dog, Fritz.&rdquo; An
      exclamation of wonder escaped me as I fell on my knees. At the same
      instant Sapt muttered, &ldquo;Ay, there&rsquo;s a lamp,&rdquo; and, stretching up his hand
      to a little oil lamp that stood on a bracket, he lit it, took it down, and
      held it over the body. It served to give a fair, though unsteady, light,
      and enabled us to see what lay in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Boris, the boar-hound,&rdquo; said I, still in a whisper, although there
      was no sign of any listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew the dog well; he was the king&rsquo;s favorite, and always accompanied
      him when he went hunting. He was obedient to every word of the king&rsquo;s, but
      of a rather uncertain temper towards the rest of the world. However, de
      mortuis nil nisi bonum; there he lay dead in the passage. Sapt put his
      hand on the beast&rsquo;s head. There was a bullet-hole right through his
      forehead. I nodded, and in my turn pointed to the dog&rsquo;s right shoulder,
      which was shattered by another ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And see here,&rdquo; said the constable. &ldquo;Have a pull at this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked where his hand now was. In the dog&rsquo;s mouth was a piece of gray
      cloth, and on the piece of gray cloth was a horn coat-button. I took hold
      of the cloth and pulled. Boris held on even in death. Sapt drew his sword,
      and, inserting the point of it between the dog&rsquo;s teeth, parted them enough
      for me to draw out the piece of cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better put it in your pocket,&rdquo; said the constable. &ldquo;Now come
      along;&rdquo; and, holding the lamp in one hand and his sword (which he did not
      resheathe) in the other, he stepped over the body of the boar-hound, and I
      followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were now in front of the door of the room where Rudolf Rassendyll had
      supped with us on the day of his first coming to Ruritania, and whence he
      had set out to be crowned in Strelsau. On the right of it was the room
      where the king slept, and farther along in the same direction the kitchen
      and the cellars. The officer or officers in attendance on the king used to
      sleep on the other side of the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must explore, I suppose,&rdquo; said Sapt. In spite of his outward calmness,
      I caught in his voice the ring of excitement rising and ill-repressed. But
      at this moment we heard from the passage on our left (as we faced the
      door) a low moan, and then a dragging sound, as if a man were crawling
      along the floor, painfully trailing his limbs after him. Sapt held the
      lamp in that direction, and we saw Herbert the forester, pale-faced and
      wide-eyed, raised from the ground on his two hands, while his legs
      stretched behind him and his stomach rested on the flags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he said in a faint voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, man, you know us,&rdquo; said the constable, stepping up to him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      happened here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow was very faint, and, I think, wandered a little in his
      brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it, sir,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it, fair and straight. No more
      hunting for me, sir. I&rsquo;ve got it here in the stomach. Oh, my God!&rdquo; He let
      his head fall with a thud on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran and raised him. Kneeling on one knee, I propped his head against my
      leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about it,&rdquo; commanded Sapt in a curt, crisp voice while I got the
      man into the easiest position that I could contrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In slow, struggling tones he began his story, repeating here, omitting
      there, often confusing the order of his narrative, oftener still arresting
      it while he waited for fresh strength. Yet we were not impatient, but
      heard without a thought of time. I looked round once at a sound, and found
      that James, anxious about us, had stolen along the passage and joined us.
      Sapt took no notice of him, nor of anything save the words that dropped in
      irregular utterance from the stricken man&rsquo;s lips. Here is the story, a
      strange instance of the turning of a great event on a small cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king had eaten a little supper, and, having gone to his bedroom, had
      stretched himself on the bed and fallen asleep without undressing. Herbert
      was clearing the dining-table and performing similar duties, when suddenly
      (thus he told it) he found a man standing beside him. He did not know (he
      was new to the king&rsquo;s service) who the unexpected visitor was, but he was
      of middle height, dark, handsome, and &ldquo;looked a gentleman all over.&rdquo; He
      was dressed in a shooting-tunic, and a revolver was thrust through the
      belt of it. One hand rested on the belt, while the other held a small
      square box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the king I am here. He expects me,&rdquo; said the stranger. Herbert,
      alarmed at the suddenness and silence of the stranger&rsquo;s approach, and
      guiltily conscious of having left the door unbolted, drew back. He was
      unarmed, but, being a stout fellow, was prepared to defend his master as
      best he could. Rupert&mdash;beyond doubt it was Rupert&mdash;laughed
      lightly, saying again, &ldquo;Man, he expects me. Go and tell him,&rdquo; and sat
      himself on the table, swinging his leg. Herbert, influenced by the
      visitor&rsquo;s air of command, began to retreat towards the bedroom, keeping
      his face towards Rupert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the king asks more, tell him I have the packet and the letter,&rdquo; said
      Rupert. The man bowed and passed into the bedroom. The king was asleep;
      when roused he seemed to know nothing of letter or packet, and to expect
      no visitor. Herbert&rsquo;s ready fears revived; he whispered that the stranger
      carried a revolver. Whatever the king&rsquo;s faults might be&mdash;and God
      forbid that I should speak hardly of him whom fate used so hardly&mdash;he
      was no coward. He sprang from his bed; at the same moment the great
      boar-hound uncoiled himself and came from beneath, yawning and fawning.
      But in an instant the beast caught the scent of a stranger: his ears
      pricked and he gave a low growl, as he looked up in his master&rsquo;s face.
      Then Rupert of Hentzau, weary perhaps of waiting, perhaps only doubtful
      whether his message would be properly delivered, appeared in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was unarmed, and Herbert in no better plight; their hunting
      weapons were in the adjoining room, and Rupert seemed to bar the way. I
      have said that the king was no coward, yet I think, that the sight of
      Rupert, bringing back the memory of his torments in the dungeon, half
      cowed him; for he shrank back crying, &ldquo;You!&rdquo; The hound, in subtle
      understanding of his master&rsquo;s movement, growled angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You expected me, sire?&rdquo; said Rupert with a bow; but he smiled. I know
      that the sight of the king&rsquo;s alarm pleased him. To inspire terror was his
      delight, and it does not come to every man to strike fear into the heart
      of a king and an Elphberg. It had come more than once to Rupert of
      Hentzau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; muttered the king. Then, recovering his composure a little, he said
      angrily, &ldquo;How dare you come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect me?&rdquo; cried Rupert, and in an instant the thought of a
      trap seemed to flash across his alert mind. He drew the revolver halfway
      from his belt, probably in a scarcely conscious movement, born of the
      desire to assure himself of its presence. With a cry of alarm Herbert
      flung himself before the king, who sank back on the bed. Rupert, puzzled,
      vexed, yet half-amused (for he smiled still, the man said), took a step
      forward, crying out something about Rischenheim&mdash;what, Herbert could
      not tell us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep back,&rdquo; exclaimed the king. &ldquo;Keep back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert paused; then, as though with a sudden thought, he held up the box
      that was in his left hand, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Well, look at this sire, and we&rsquo;ll talk afterwards,&rdquo; and he stretched
      out his hand with the box in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the king stood on a razor&rsquo;s edge, for the king whispered to Herbert,
      &ldquo;What is it? Go and take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Herbert hesitated, fearing to leave the king, whom his body now
      protected as though with a shield. Rupert&rsquo;s impatience overcame him: if
      there were a trap, every moment&rsquo;s delay doubled his danger. With a
      scornful laugh he exclaimed, &ldquo;Catch it, then, if you&rsquo;re afraid to come for
      it,&rdquo; and he flung the packet to Herbert or the king, or which of them
      might chance to catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This insolence had a strange result. In an instant, with a fierce growl
      and a mighty bound, Boris was at the stranger&rsquo;s throat. Rupert had not
      seen or had not heeded the dog. A startled oath rang out from him. He
      snatched the revolver from his belt and fired at his assailant. This shot
      must have broken the beast&rsquo;s shoulder, but it only half arrested his
      spring. His great weight was still hurled on Rupert&rsquo;s chest, and bore him
      back on his knee. The packet that he had flung lay unheeded. The king,
      wild with alarm and furious with anger at his favorite&rsquo;s fate, jumped up
      and ran past Rupert into the next room. Herbert followed; even as they
      went Rupert flung the wounded, weakened beast from him and darted to the
      doorway. He found himself facing Herbert, who held a boar-spear, and the
      king, who had a double-barreled hunting-gun. He raised his left hand,
      Herbert said&mdash;no doubt he still asked a hearing&mdash;but the king
      leveled his weapon. With a spring Rupert gained the shelter of the door,
      the bullet sped by him, and buried itself in the wall of the room. Then
      Herbert was at him with the boar-spear. Explanations must wait now: it was
      life or death; without hesitation Rupert fired at Herbert, bringing him to
      the ground with a mortal wound. The king&rsquo;s gun was at his shoulder again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You damned fool!&rdquo; roared Rupert, &ldquo;if you must have it, take it,&rdquo; and gun
      and revolver rang out at the same moment. But Rupert&mdash;never did his
      nerve fail him&mdash;hit, the king missed; Herbert saw the count stand for
      an instant with his smoking barrel in his hand, looking at the king, who
      lay on the ground. Then Rupert walked towards the door. I wish I had seen
      his face then! Did he frown or smile? Was triumph or chagrin uppermost?
      Remorse? Not he!
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the door and passed through. That was the last Herbert saw of
      him; but the fourth actor in the drama, the wordless player whose part had
      been so momentous, took the stage. Limping along, now whining in sharp
      agony, now growling in fierce anger, with blood flowing but hair
      bristling, the hound Boris dragged himself across the room, through the
      door, after Rupert of Hentzau. Herbert listened, raising his head from the
      ground. There was a growl, an oath, the sound of the scuffle. Rupert must
      have turned in time to receive the dog&rsquo;s spring. The beast, maimed and
      crippled by his shattered shoulder, did not reach his enemy&rsquo;s face, but
      his teeth tore away the bit of cloth that we had found held in the vise of
      his jaws. Then came another shot, a laugh, retreating steps, and a door
      slammed. With that last sound Herbert woke to the fact of the count&rsquo;s
      escape; with weary efforts he dragged himself into the passage. The idea
      that he could go on if he got a drink of brandy turned him in the
      direction of the cellar. But his strength failed, and he sank down where
      we found him, not knowing whether the king were dead or still alive, and
      unable even to make his way back to the room where his master lay
      stretched on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had listened to the story, bound as though by a spell. Halfway through,
      James&rsquo;s hand had crept to my arm and rested there; when Herbert finished I
      heard the little man licking his lips, again and again slapping his tongue
      against them. Then I looked at Sapt. He was as pale as a ghost, and the
      lines on his face seemed to have grown deeper. He glanced up, and met my
      regard. Neither of us spoke; we exchanged thoughts with our eyes. &ldquo;This is
      our work,&rdquo; we said to one another. &ldquo;It was our trap, these are our
      victims.&rdquo; I cannot even now think of that hour, for by our act the king
      lay dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was he dead? I seized Sapt by the arm. His glance questioned me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king,&rdquo; I whispered hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the king,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Facing round, we walked to the door of the dining-room. Here I turned
      suddenly faint, and clutched at the constable. He held me up, and pushed
      the door wide open. The smell of powder was in the room; it seemed as if
      the smoke hung about, curling in dim coils round the chandelier which gave
      a subdued light. James had the lamp now, and followed us with it. But the
      king was not there. A sudden hope filled me. He had not been killed then!
      I regained strength, and darted across towards the inside room. Here too
      the light was dim, and I turned to beckon for the lamp. Sapt and James
      came together, and stood peering over my shoulder in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king lay prone on the floor, face downwards, near the bed. He had
      crawled there, seeking for some place to rest, as we supposed. He did not
      move. We watched him for a moment; the silence seemed deeper than silence
      could be. At last, moved by a common impulse, we stepped forward, but
      timidly, as though we approached the throne of Death himself. I was the
      first to kneel by the king and raise his head. Blood had flowed from his
      lips, but it had ceased to flow now. He was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt Sapt&rsquo;s hand on my shoulder. Looking up, I saw his other hand
      stretched out towards the ground. I turned my eyes where he pointed.
      There, in the king&rsquo;s hand, stained with the king&rsquo;sblood, was the box that
      I had carried to Wintenberg and Rupert of Hentzau had brought to the lodge
      that night. It was not rest, but the box that the dying king had sought in
      his last moment. I bent, and lifting his hand unclasped the fingers, still
      limp and warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt bent down with sudden eagerness. &ldquo;Is it open?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The string was round it; the sealing-wax was unbroken. The secret had
      outlived the king, and he had gone to his death unknowing. All at once&mdash;I
      cannot tell why&mdash;I put my hand over my eyes; I found my eyelashes
      were wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it open?&rdquo; asked Sapt again, for in the dim light he could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; said he. And, for Sapt&rsquo;s, the voice was soft.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE KING IN THE HUNTING LODGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE moment with its shock and tumult of feeling brings one judgment, later
      reflection another. Among the sins of Rupert of Hentzau I do not assign
      the first and greatest place to his killing of the king. It was, indeed,
      the act of a reckless man who stood at nothing and held nothing sacred;
      but when I consider Herbert&rsquo;s story, and trace how the deed came to be
      done and the impulsion of circumstances that led to it, it seems to have
      been in some sort thrust upon him by the same perverse fate that dogged
      our steps. He had meant the king no harm&mdash;indeed it may be argued
      that, from whatever motive, he had sought to serve him&mdash;and save
      under the sudden stress of self-defense he had done him none. The king&rsquo;s
      unlooked-for ignorance of his errand, Herbert&rsquo;s honest hasty zeal, the
      temper of Boris the hound, had forced on him an act unmeditated and
      utterly against his interest. His whole guilt lay in preferring the king&rsquo;s
      death to his own&mdash;a crime perhaps in most men, but hardly deserving a
      place in Rupert&rsquo;s catalogue. All this I can admit now, but on that night,
      with the dead body lying there before us, with the story piteously told by
      Herbert&rsquo;s faltering voice fresh in our ears, it was hard to allow any such
      extenuation. Our hearts cried out for vengeance, although we ourselves
      served the king no more. Nay, it may well be that we hoped to stifle some
      reproach of our own consciences by a louder clamor against another&rsquo;s sin,
      or longed to offer some belated empty atonement to our dead master by
      executing swift justice on the man who had killed him. I cannot tell fully
      what the others felt, but in me at least the dominant impulse was to waste
      not a moment in proclaiming the crime and raising the whole country in
      pursuit of Rupert, so that every man in Ruritania should quit his work,
      his pleasure, or his bed, and make it his concern to take the Count of
      Hentzau, alive or dead. I remember that I walked over to where Sapt was
      sitting, and caught him by the arm, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must raise the alarm. If you&rsquo;ll go to Zenda, I&rsquo;ll start for Strelsau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The alarm?&rdquo; said he, looking up at me and tugging his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: when the news is known, every man in the kingdom will be on the
      lookout for him, and he can&rsquo;t escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that he&rsquo;d be taken?&rdquo; asked the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to a certainty,&rdquo; I cried, hot in excitement and emotion. Sapt
      glanced across at Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s servant. James had, with my help,
      raised the king&rsquo;s body on to the bed, and had aided the wounded forester
      to reach a couch. He stood now near the constable, in his usual
      unobtrusive readiness. He did not speak, but I saw a look of understanding
      in his eyes as he nodded his head to Colonel Sapt. They were well matched,
      that pair, hard to move, hard to shake, not to be turned from the purpose
      in their minds and the matter that lay to their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;d probably be taken or killed,&rdquo; said Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the queen&rsquo;s letter on him,&rdquo; said Colonel Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have the box, he has the letter still,&rdquo; said Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could have laughed even at that moment. He had left the box (whether
      from haste or heedlessness or malice, we could not tell), but the letter
      was on him. Taken alive, he would use that powerful weapon to save his
      life or satisfy his anger; if it were found on his body, its evidence
      would speak loud and clear to all the world. Again he was protected by his
      crime: while he had the letter, he must be kept inviolate from all attack
      except at our own hands. We desired his death, but we must be his
      body-guard and die in his defense rather than let any other but ourselves
      come at him. No open means must be used, and no allies sought. All this
      rushed to my mind at Sapt&rsquo;s words, and I saw what the constable and James
      had never forgotten. But what to do I could not see. For the King of
      Ruritania lay dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour or more had passed since our discovery, and it was now close on
      midnight. Had all gone well we ought by this time to have been far on our
      road back to the castle; by this time Rupert must be miles away from where
      he had killed the king; already Mr. Rassendyll would be seeking his enemy
      in Strelsau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are we to do about&mdash;about that, then?&rdquo; I asked, pointing
      with my finger through the doorway towards the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt gave a last tug at his moustache, then crossed his hands on the hilt
      of the sword between his knees, and leant forward in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, he said,&rdquo; looking at my face. &ldquo;Until we have the letter,
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, Fritz,&rdquo; he answered thoughtfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible yet; it may
      become so. But if we can catch Rupert in the next day, or even in the next
      two days, it&rsquo;s not impossible. Only let me have the letter, and I&rsquo;ll
      account for the concealment. What? Is the fact that crimes are known never
      concealed, for fear of putting the criminal on his guard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to make a story, sir,&rdquo; James put in, with a grave but
      reassuring air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, James, I shall be able to make a story, or your master will make one
      for me. But, by God, story or no story, the letter mustn&rsquo;t be found. Let
      them say we killed him ourselves if they like, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I seized his hand and gripped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t doubt I&rsquo;m with you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a moment, Fritz,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how can we do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We drew nearer together; Sapt and I sat, while James leant over Sapt&rsquo;s
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oil in the lamp was almost exhausted, and the light burnt very dim.
      Now and again poor Herbert, for whom our skill could do nothing, gave a
      slight moan. I am ashamed to remember how little we thought of him, but
      great schemes make the actors in them careless of humanity; the life of a
      man goes for nothing against a point in the game. Except for his groans&mdash;and
      they grew fainter and less frequent&mdash;our voices alone broke the
      silence of the little lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen must know,&rdquo; said Sapt. &ldquo;Let her stay at Zenda and give out that
      the king is at the lodge for a day or two longer. Then you, Fritz&mdash;for
      you must ride to the castle at once&mdash;and Bernenstein must get to
      Strelsau as quick as you can, and find Rudolf Rassendyll. You three ought
      to be able to track young Rupert down and get the letter from him. If he&rsquo;s
      not in the city, you must catch Rischenheim, and force him to say where he
      is; we know Rischenheim can be persuaded. If Rupert&rsquo;s there, I need give
      no advice either to you or to Rudolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James and I stay here. If any one comes whom we can keep out, the king is
      ill. If rumors get about, and great folk come, why, they must enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the body?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning, when you&rsquo;re gone, we shall make a temporary grave. I dare
      say two,&rdquo; and he jerked his thumb towards poor Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or even,&rdquo; he added, with his grim smile, &ldquo;three&mdash;for our friend
      Boris, too, must be out of sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll bury the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so deep but that we can take him out again, poor fellow. Well, Fritz,
      have you a better plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had no plan, and I was not in love with Sapt&rsquo;s plan. Yet it offered us
      four and twenty hours. For that time, at least, it seemed as if the secret
      could be kept. Beyond that we could hardly hope for success; after that we
      must produce the king; dead or alive, the king must be seen. Yet it might
      be that before the respite ran out Rupert would be ours. In fine, what
      else could be chosen? For now a greater peril threatened than that against
      which we had at the first sought to guard. Then the worst we feared was
      that the letter should come to the king&rsquo;s hands. That could never be. But
      it would be a worse thing if it were found on Rupert, and all the kingdom,
      nay, all Europe, know that it was written in the hand of her who was now,
      in her own right, Queen of Ruritania. To save her from that, no chance was
      too desperate, no scheme too perilous; yes, if, as Sapt said, we ourselves
      were held to answer for the king&rsquo;s death, still we must go on. I, through
      whose negligence the whole train of disaster had been laid, was the last
      man to hesitate. In all honesty, I held my life due and forfeit, should it
      be demanded of me&mdash;my life and, before the world, my honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the plan was made. A grave was to be dug ready for the king; if need
      arose, his body should be laid in it, and the place chosen was under the
      floor of the wine-cellar. When death came to poor Herbert, he could lie in
      the yard behind the house; for Boris they meditated a resting-place under
      the tree where our horses were tethered. There was nothing to keep me, and
      I rose; but as I rose, I heard the forester&rsquo;s voice call plaintively for
      me. The unlucky fellow knew me well, and now cried to me to sit by him. I
      think Sapt wanted me to leave him, but I could not refuse his last
      request, even though it consumed some precious minutes. He was very near
      his end, and, sitting by him, I did my best to soothe his passing. His
      fortitude was good to see, and I believe that we all at last found new
      courage for our enterprise from seeing how this humble man met death. At
      least even the constable ceased to show impatience, and let me stay till I
      could close the sufferer&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But thus time went, and it was nearly five in the morning before I bade
      them farewell and mounted my horse. They took theirs and led them away to
      the stables behind the lodge; I waved my hand and galloped off on my
      return to the castle. Day was dawning, and the air was fresh and pure. The
      new light brought new hope; fears seemed to vanish before it; my nerves
      were strung to effort and to confidence. My horse moved freely under me
      and carried me easily along the grassy avenues. It was hard then to be
      utterly despondent, hard to doubt skill of brain, strength of hand, or
      fortune&rsquo;s favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castle came in sight, and I hailed it with a glad cry that echoed
      among the trees. But a moment later I gave an exclamation of surprise, and
      raised myself a little from the saddle while I gazed earnestly at the
      summit of the keep. The flag staff was naked; the royal standard that had
      flapped in the wind last night was gone. But by immemorial custom the flag
      flew on the keep when the king or the queen was at the castle. It would
      fly for Rudolf V. no more; but why did it not proclaim and honor the
      presence of Queen Flavia? I sat down in my saddle and spurred my horse to
      the top of his speed. We had been buffeted by fate sorely, but now I
      feared yet another blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour more I was at the door. A servant ran out, and I
      dismounted leisurely and easily. Pulling off my gloves, I dusted my boots
      with them, turned to the stableman and bade him look to the horse, and
      then said to the footman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as the queen is dressed, find out if she can see me. I have a
      message from his Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fellow looked a little puzzled, but at this moment Hermann, the king&rsquo;s
      major-domo, came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the constable with you, my lord?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the constable remains at the lodge with the king,&rdquo; said I carelessly,
      though I was very far from careless. &ldquo;I have a message for her Majesty,
      Hermann. Find out from some of the women when she will receive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Indeed we&rsquo;ve had a lively time, my lord.
      At five o&rsquo;clock she came out, ready dressed, from her room, sent for
      Lieutenant von Bernenstein, and announced that she was about to set out
      from the castle. As you know, the mail train passes here at six.&rdquo; Hermann
      took out his watch. &ldquo;Yes, the queen must just have left the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where for?&rdquo; I asked, with a shrug for the woman&rsquo;s whim. &ldquo;Why, for
      Strelsau. She gave no reasons for going, and took with her only one lady,
      Lieutenant von Bernenstein being in attendance. It was a bustle, if you
      like, with everybody to be roused and got out of bed, and a carriage to be
      made ready, and messages to go to the station, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave no reasons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, my lord. She left with me a letter to the constable, which she
      ordered me to give to his own hands as soon as he arrived at the castle.
      She said it contained a message of importance, which the constable was to
      convey to the king, and that it must be intrusted to nobody except Colonel
      Sapt himself. I wonder, my lord, that you didn&rsquo;t notice that the flag was
      hauled down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, man, I wasn&rsquo;t staring at the keep. Give me the letter.&rdquo; For I saw
      that the clue to this fresh puzzle must lie under the cover of Sapt&rsquo;s
      letter. That letter I must myself carry to Sapt, and without loss of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give you the letter, my lord? But, pardon me, you&rsquo;re not the constable.&rdquo;
       He laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said I, mustering a smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that I&rsquo;m not the
      constable, but I&rsquo;m going to the constable. I had the king&rsquo;s orders to
      rejoin him as soon as I had seen the queen, and since her Majesty isn&rsquo;t
      here, I shall return to the lodge directly a fresh horse can be saddled
      for me. And the constable&rsquo;s at the lodge. Come, the letter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give it you, my lord. Her Majesty&rsquo;s orders were positive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! If she had known I should come and not the constable, she would
      have told me to carry it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, my lord: her orders were plain, and she doesn&rsquo;t
      like being disobeyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stableman had led the horse away, the footman had disappeared, Hermann
      and I were alone. &ldquo;Give me the letter,&rdquo; I said; and I know that my
      self-control failed, and eagerness was plain in my voice. Plain it was,
      and Hermann took alarm. He started back, clapping his hand to the breast
      of his laced coat. The gesture betrayed where the letter was; I was past
      prudence; I sprang on him and wrenched his hand away, catching him by the
      throat with my other hand. Diving into his pocket, I got the letter. Then
      I suddenly loosed hold of him, for his eyes were starting out of his head.
      I took out a couple of gold pieces and gave them to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s urgent, you fool,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Hold your tongue about it.&rdquo; And without
      waiting to study his amazed red face, I turned and ran towards the stable.
      In five minutes I was on a fresh horse, in six I was clear of the castle,
      heading back fast as I could go for the hunting-lodge. Even now Hermann
      remembers the grip I gave him&mdash;though doubtless he has long spent the
      pieces of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reached the end of this second journey, I came in for the obsequies
      of Boris. James was just patting the ground under the tree with a mattock
      when I rode up; Sapt was standing by, smoking his pipe. The boots of both
      were stained and sticky with mud. I flung myself from my saddle and
      blurted out my news. The constable snatched at his letter with an oath;
      James leveled the ground with careful accuracy; I do not remember doing
      anything except wiping my forehead and feeling very hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, she&rsquo;s gone after him!&rdquo; said Sapt, as he read. Then he handed
      me the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not set out what the queen wrote. The purport seemed to us, who did
      not share her feelings, pathetic indeed and moving, but in the end (to
      speak plainly) folly. She had tried to endure her sojourn at Zenda, she
      said; but it drove her mad. She could not rest; she did not know how we
      fared, nor how those in Strelsau; for hours she had lain awake; then at
      last falling asleep, she had dreamt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had had the same dream before. Now it came again. I saw him so plain.
      He seemed to me to be king, and to be called king. But he did not answer
      nor move. He seemed dead; and I could not rest.&rdquo; So she wrote, ever
      excusing herself, ever repeating how something drew her to Strelsau,
      telling her that she must go if she would see &ldquo;him whom you know,&rdquo; alive
      again. &ldquo;And I must see him&mdash;ah, I must see him! If the king has had
      the letter, I am ruined already. If he has not, tell him what you will or
      what you can contrive. I must go. It came a second time, and all so plain.
      I saw him; I tell you I saw him. Ah, I must see him again. I swear that I
      will only see him once. He&rsquo;s in danger&mdash;I know he&rsquo;s in danger; or
      what does the dream mean? Bernenstein will go with me, and I shall see
      him. Do, do forgive me: I can&rsquo;t stay, the dream was so plain.&rdquo; Thus she
      ended, seeming, poor lady, half frantic with the visions that her own
      troubled brain and desolate heart had conjured up to torment her. I did
      not know that she had before told Mr. Rassendyll himself of this strange
      dream; though I lay small store by such matters, believing that we
      ourselves make our dreams, fashioning out of the fears and hopes of to-day
      what seems to come by night in the guise of a mysterious revelation. Yet
      there are some things that a man cannot understand, and I do not profess
      to measure with my mind the ways of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, not why the queen went, but that she had gone, concerned us. We
      had returned to the house now, and James, remembering that men must eat
      though kings die, was getting us some breakfast. In fact, I had great need
      of food, being utterly worn out; and they, after their labors, were hardly
      less weary. As we ate, we talked; and it was plain to us that I also must
      go to Strelsau. There, in the city, the drama must be played out. There
      was Rudolf, there Rischenheim, there in all likelihood Rupert of Hentzau,
      there now the queen. And of these Rupert alone, or perhaps Rischenheim
      also, knew that the king was dead, and how the issue of last night had
      shaped itself under the compelling hand of wayward fortune. The king lay
      in peace on his bed, his grave was dug; Sapt and James held the secret
      with solemn faith and ready lives. To Strelsau I must go to tell the queen
      that she was widowed, and to aim the stroke at young Rupert&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine in the morning I started from the lodge. I was bound to ride to
      Hofbau and there wait for a train which would carry me to the capital.
      From Hofbau I could send a message, but the message must announce only my
      own coming, not the news I carried. To Sapt, thanks to the cipher, I could
      send word at any time, and he bade me ask Mr. Rassendyll whether he should
      come to our aid, or stay where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A day must decide the whole thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t conceal the king&rsquo;s
      death long. For God&rsquo;s sake, Fritz, make an end of that young villain, and
      get the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, wasting no time in farewells, I set out. By ten o&rsquo;clock I was at
      Hofbau, for I rode furiously. From there I sent to Bernenstein at the
      palace word of my coming. But there I was delayed. There was no train for
      an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ride,&rdquo; I cried to myself, only to remember the next moment that, if
      I rode, I should come to my journey&rsquo;s end much later. There was nothing
      for it but to wait, and it may be imagined in what mood I waited. Every
      minute seemed an hour, and I know not to this day how the hour wore itself
      away. I ate, I drank, I smoked, I walked, sat, and stood. The
      stationmaster knew me, and thought I had gone mad, till I told him that I
      carried most important despatches from the king, and that the delay
      imperiled great interests. Then he became sympathetic; but what could he
      do? No special train was to be had at a roadside station: I must wait; and
      wait, somehow, and without blowing my brains out, I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I was in the train; now indeed we moved, and I came nearer. An
      hour&rsquo;s run brought me in sight of the city. Then, to my unutterable wrath,
      we were stopped, and waited motionless twenty minutes or half an hour. At
      last we started again; had we not, I should have jumped out and run, for
      to sit longer would have driven me mad. Now we entered the station. With a
      great effort I calmed myself. I lolled back in my seat; when we stopped I
      sat there till a porter opened the door. In lazy leisureliness I bade him
      get me a cab, and followed him across the station. He held the door for
      me, and, giving him his douceur, I set my foot on the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him to drive to the palace,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and be quick. I&rsquo;m late
      already, thanks to this cursed train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old mare&rsquo;ll soon take you there, sir,&rdquo; said the driver. I jumped in.
      But at this moment I saw a man on the platform beckoning with his hand and
      hastening towards me. The cabman also saw him and waited. I dared not tell
      him to drive on, for I feared to betray any undue haste, and it would have
      looked strange not to spare a moment to my wife&rsquo;s cousin, Anton von
      Strofzin. He came up, holding out his hand delicately gloved in pearl-gray
      kid, for young Anton was a leader of the Strelsau dandies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Fritz!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am glad I hold no appointment at court.
      How dreadfully active you all are! I thought you were settled at Zenda for
      a month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen changed her mind suddenly,&rdquo; said I, smiling. &ldquo;Ladies do, as you
      know well, you who know all about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My compliment, or insinuation, produced a pleased smile and a gallant
      twirling of his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought you&rsquo;d be here soon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know that the
      queen had come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t? Then why did you look for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened his eyes a little in languid, elegant surprise. &ldquo;Oh, I supposed
      you&rsquo;d be on duty, or something, and have to come. Aren&rsquo;t you in
      attendance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the queen? No, not just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But on the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said I, and I leaned forward. &ldquo;At least I&rsquo;m engaged now on the
      king&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;So I thought you&rsquo;d come, as soon as I heard that
      the king was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be that I ought to have preserved my composure. But I am not Sapt
      nor Rudolf Rassendyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king here?&rdquo; I gasped, clutching him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. You didn&rsquo;t know? Yes, he&rsquo;s in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I heeded him no more. For a moment I could not speak, then I cried to
      the cabman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the palace. And drive like the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We shot away, leaving Anton open-mouthed in wonder. For me, I sank back on
      the cushions, fairly aghast. The king lay dead in the hunting-lodge, but
      the king was in his capital!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the truth soon flashed through my mind, but it brought no
      comfort. Rudolf Rassendyll was in Strelsau. He had been seen by somebody
      and taken for the king. But comfort? What comfort was there, now that the
      king was dead and could never come to the rescue of his counterfeit?
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the truth was worse than I conceived. Had I known it all, I might
      well have yielded to despair. For not by the chance, uncertain sight of a
      passer-by, not by mere rumor which might have been sturdily denied, not by
      the evidence of one only or of two, was the king&rsquo;s presence in the city
      known. That day, by the witness of a crowd of people, by his own claim and
      his own voice, ay, and by the assent of the queen herself, Mr. Rassendyll
      was taken to be the king in Strelsau, while neither he nor Queen Flavia
      knew that the king was dead. I must now relate the strange and perverse
      succession of events which forced them to employ a resource so dangerous
      and face a peril so immense. Yet, great and perilous as they knew the risk
      to be even when they dared it, in the light of what they did not know it
      was more fearful and more fatal still.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE KING IN STRELSAU
    </h2>
    <p>
      MR. RASSENDYLL reached Strelsau from Zenda without accident about nine
      o&rsquo;clock in the evening of the same day as that which witnessed the tragedy
      of the hunting-lodge. He could have arrived sooner, but prudence did not
      allow him to enter the populous suburbs of the town till the darkness
      guarded him from notice. The gates of the city were no longer shut at
      sunset, as they had used to be in the days when Duke Michael was governor,
      and Rudolf passed them without difficulty. Fortunately the night, fine
      where we were, was wet and stormy at Strelsau; thus there were few people
      in the streets, and he was able to gain the door of my house still
      unremarked. Here, of course, a danger presented itself. None of my
      servants were in the secret; only my wife, in whom the queen herself had
      confided, knew Rudolf, and she did not expect to see him, since she was
      ignorant of the recent course of events. Rudolf was quite alive to the
      peril, and regretted the absence of his faithful attendant, who could have
      cleared the way for him. The pouring rain gave him an excuse for twisting
      a scarf about his face and pulling his coat-collar up to his ears, while
      the gusts of wind made the cramming of his hat low down over his eyes no
      more than a natural precaution against its loss. Thus masked from curious
      eyes, he drew rein before my door, and, having dismounted, rang the bell.
      When the butler came a strange hoarse voice, half-stifled by folds of
      scarf, asked for the countess, alleging for pretext a message from myself.
      The man hesitated, as well he might, to leave the stranger alone with the
      door open and the contents of the hall at his mercy. Murmuring an apology
      in case his visitor should prove to be a gentleman, he shut the door and
      went in search of his mistress. His description of the untimely caller at
      once roused my wife&rsquo;s quick wit; she had heard from me how Rudolf had
      ridden once from Strelsau to the hunting-lodge with muffled face; a very
      tall man with his face wrapped in a scarf and his hat over his eyes, who
      came with a private message, suggested to her at least a possibility of
      Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s arrival. Helga will never admit that she is clever, yet I
      find she discovers from me what she wants to know, and I suspect hides
      successfully the small matters of which she in her wifely discretion deems
      I had best remain ignorant. Being able thus to manage me, she was equal to
      coping with the butler. She laid aside her embroidery most composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know the gentleman. Surely you haven&rsquo;t left him
      out in the rain?&rdquo; She was anxious lest Rudolf&rsquo;s features should have been
      exposed too long to the light of the hall-lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler stammered an apology, explaining his fears for our goods and
      the impossibility of distinguishing social rank on a dark night. Helga cut
      him short with an impatient gesture, crying, &ldquo;How stupid of you!&rdquo; and
      herself ran quickly down and opened the door&mdash;a little way only,
      though. The first sight of Mr. Rassendyll confirmed her suspicions; in a
      moment, she said, she knew his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is you, then?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And my foolish servant has left you in the
      rain! Pray come in. Oh, but your horse!&rdquo; She turned to the penitent
      butler, who had followed her downstairs. &ldquo;Take the baron&rsquo;s horse round to
      the stables,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send some one at once, my lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, take it yourself&mdash;take it at once. I&rsquo;ll look after the
      baron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly and ruefully the fat fellow stepped out into the storm. Rudolf
      drew back and let him pass, then he entered quickly, to find himself alone
      with Helga in the hall. With a finger on her lips, she led him swiftly
      into a small sitting-room on the ground floor, which I used as a sort of
      office or place of business. It looked out on the street, and the rain
      could be heard driving against the broad panes of the window. Rudolf
      turned to her with a smile, and, bowing, kissed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The baron what, my dear countess?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t ask,&rdquo; said she with a shrug. &ldquo;Do tell me what brings you here,
      and what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told her very briefly all he knew. She hid bravely her alarm at hearing
      that I might perhaps meet Rupert at the lodge, and at once listened to
      what Rudolf wanted of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I get out of the house, and, if need be, back again unnoticed?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door is locked at night, and only Fritz and the butler have keys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s eye traveled to the window of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t grown so fat that I can&rsquo;t get through there,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;d
      better not trouble the butler. He&rsquo;d talk, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will sit here all night and keep everybody from the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may come back pursued if I bungle my work and an alarm is raised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your work?&rdquo; she asked, shrinking back a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask what it is, Countess. It is in the queen&rsquo;s
      service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the queen I will do anything and everything, as Fritz would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand and pressed it in a friendly, encouraging way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may issue my orders?&rdquo; he asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall be obeyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then a dry cloak, a little supper, and this room to myself, except for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the butler turned the handle of the door. My wife flew across
      the room, opened the door, and, while Rudolf turned his back, directed the
      man to bring some cold meat, or whatever could be ready with as little
      delay as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now come with me,&rdquo; she said to Rudolf, directly the servant was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him to my dressing-room, where he got dry clothes; then she saw
      the supper laid, ordered a bedroom to be prepared, told the butler that
      she had business with the baron and that he need not sit up if she were
      later than eleven, dismissed him, and went to tell Rudolf that the coast
      was clear for his return to the sitting-room. He came, expressing
      admiration for her courage and address; I take leave to think that she
      deserved his compliments. He made a hasty supper; then they talked
      together, Rudolf smoking his cigar. Eleven came and went. It was not yet
      time. My wife opened the door and looked out. The hall was dark, the door
      locked and its key in the hands of the butler. She closed the door again
      and softly locked it. As the clock struck twelve Rudolf rose and turned
      the lamp very low. Then he unfastened the shutters noiselessly, raised the
      window and looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut them again when I&rsquo;m gone,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;If I come back, I&rsquo;ll knock
      like this, and you&rsquo;ll open for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, be careful,&rdquo; she murmured, catching at his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded reassuringly, and crossing his leg over the windowsill, sat
      there for a moment listening. The storm was as fierce as ever, and the
      street was deserted. He let himself down on to the pavement, his face
      again wrapped up. She watched his tall figure stride quickly along till a
      turn of the road hid it. Then, having closed the window and the shutters
      again, she sat down to keep her watch, praying for him, for me, and for
      her dear mistress the queen. For she knew that perilous work was afoot
      that night, and did not know whom it might threaten or whom destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment that Mr. Rassendyll thus left my house at midnight on his
      search for Rupert of Hentzau, every hour and almost every moment brought
      its incident in the swiftly moving drama which decided the issues of our
      fortune. What we were doing has been told; by now Rupert himself was on
      his way back to the city, and the queen was meditating, in her restless
      vigil, on the resolve that in a few hours was to bring her also to
      Strelsau. Even in the dead of night both sides were active. For, plan
      cautiously and skillfully as he might, Rudolf fought with an antagonist
      who lost no chances, and who had found an apt and useful tool in that same
      Bauer, a rascal, and a cunning rascal, if ever one were bred in the world.
      From the beginning even to the end our error lay in taking too little
      count of this fellow, and dear was the price we paid.

    <p>
      Both to my wife and to Rudolf himself the street had seemed empty of every
      living being when she watched and he set out. Yet everything had been
      seen, from his first arrival to the moment when she closed the window
      after him. At either end of my house there runs out a projection, formed
      by the bay windows of the principal drawing-room and of the dining room
      respectively. These projecting walls form shadows, and in the shade of one
      of them&mdash;of which I do not know, nor is it of moment&mdash;a man
      watched all that passed; had he been anywhere else, Rudolf must have seen
      him. If we had not been too engrossed in playing our own hands, it would
      doubtless have struck us as probable that Rupert would direct Rischenheim
      and Bauer to keep an eye on my house during his absence; for it was there
      that any of us who found our way to the city would naturally resort in the
      first instance. As a fact, he had not omitted this precaution. The night
      was so dark that the spy, who had seen the king but once and never Mr.
      Rassendyll, did not recognize who the visitor was, but he rightly
      conceived that he should serve his employer by tracking the steps of the
      tall man who made so mysterious an arrival and so surreptitious a
      departure from the suspected house. Accordingly, as Rudolf turned the
      corner and Helena closed the window, a short, thickset figure started
      cautiously out of the projecting shadow, and followed in Rudolf&rsquo;s wake
      through the storm. The pair, tracker and tracked, met nobody, save here
      and there a police constable keeping a most unwilling beat. Even such were
      few, and for the most part more intent on sheltering in the lee of a
      friendly wall and thereby keeping a dry stitch or two on them than on
      taking note of passers-by. On the pair went. Now Rudolf turned into the
      Konigstrasse. As he did so, Bauer, who must have been nearly a hundred
      yards behind (for he could not start till the shutters were closed)
      quickened his pace and reduced the interval between them to about seventy
      yards. This he might well have thought a safe distance on a night so wild,
      when the rush of wind and the pelt of the rain joined to hide the sound of
      footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bauer reasoned as a townsman, and Rudolf Rassendyll had the quick ear
      of a man bred in the country and trained to the woodland. All at once
      there was a jerk of his head; I know so well the motion which marked
      awakened attention in him. He did not pause nor break his stride: to do
      either would have been to betray his suspicions to his follower; but he
      crossed the road to the opposite side to that where No. 19 was situated,
      and slackened his pace a little, so that there was a longer interval
      between his own footfalls. The steps behind him grew slower, even as his
      did; their sound came no nearer: the follower would not overtake. Now, a
      man who loiters on such a night, just because another ahead of him is fool
      enough to loiter, has a reason for his action other than what can at first
      sight be detected. So thought Rudolf Rassendyll, and his brain was busied
      with finding it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then an idea seized him, and, forgetting the precautions that had hitherto
      served so well, he came to a sudden stop on the pavement, engrossed in
      deep thought. Was the man who dogged his steps Rupert himself? It would be
      like Rupert to track him, like Rupert to conceive such an attack, like
      Rupert to be ready either for a fearless assault from the front or a
      shameless shot from behind, and indifferent utterly which chance offered,
      so it threw him one of them. Mr. Rassendyll asked no better than to meet
      his enemy thus in the open. They could fight a fair fight, and if he fell
      the lamp would be caught up and carried on by Sapt&rsquo;s hand or mine; if he
      got the better of Rupert, the letter would be his; a moment would destroy
      it and give safety to the queen. I do not suppose that he spent time in
      thinking how he should escape arrest at the hands of the police whom the
      fracas would probably rouse; if he did, he may well have reckoned on
      declaring plainly who he was, of laughing at their surprise over a chance
      likeness to the king, and of trusting to us to smuggle him beyond the arm
      of the law. What mattered all that, so that there was a moment in which to
      destroy the letter? At any rate he turned full round and began to walk
      straight towards Bauer, his hand resting on the revolver in the pocket of
      his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bauer saw him coming, and must have known that he was suspected or
      detected. At once the cunning fellow slouched his head between his
      shoulders, and set out along the street at a quick shuffle, whistling as
      he went. Rudolf stood still now in the middle of the road, wondering who
      the man was: whether Rupert, purposely disguising his gait, or a
      confederate, or, after all, some person innocent of our secret and
      indifferent to our schemes. On came Bauer, softly, whistling and slushing
      his feet carelessly through the liquid mud. Now he was nearly opposite
      where Mr. Rassendyll stood. Rudolf was well-nigh convinced that the man
      had been on his track: he would make certainty surer. The bold game was
      always his choice and his delight; this trait he shared with Rupert of
      Hentzau, and hence arose, I think, the strange secret inclination he had
      for his unscrupulous opponent. Now he walked suddenly across to Bauer, and
      spoke to him in his natural voice, at the same time removing the scarf
      partly, but not altogether, from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re out late, my friend, for a night like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bauer, startled though he was by the unexpected challenge, had his wits
      about him. Whether he identified Rudolf at once, I do not know; I think
      that he must at least have suspected the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lad that has no home to go to must needs be out both late and early,
      sir,&rdquo; said he, arresting his shuffling steps, and looking up with that
      honest stolid air which had made a fool of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had described him very minutely to Mr. Rassendyll; if Bauer knew or
      guessed who his challenger was, Mr. Rassendyll was as well equipped for
      the encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No home to go to!&rdquo; cried Rudolf in a pitying tone. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that? But
      anyhow, Heaven forbid that you or any man should walk the streets a night
      like this. Come, I&rsquo;ll give you a bed. Come with me, and I&rsquo;ll find you good
      shelter, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bauer shrank away. He did not see the meaning of this stroke, and his eye,
      traveling up the street, showed that his thoughts had turned towards
      flight. Rudolf gave no time for putting any such notion into effect.
      Maintaining his air of genial compassion, he passed his left arm through
      Bauer&rsquo;s right, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Christian man, and a bed you shall have this night, my lad, as sure
      as I&rsquo;m alive. Come along with me. The devil, it&rsquo;s not weather for standing
      still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carrying of arms in Strelsau was forbidden. Bauer had no wish to get
      into trouble with the police, and, moreover, he had intended nothing but a
      reconnaissance; he was therefore without any weapon, and he was a child in
      Rudolf&rsquo;s grasp. He had no alternative but to obey the suasion of Mr.
      Rassendyll&rsquo;s arm, and they two began to walk down the Konigstrasse.
      Bauer&rsquo;s whistle had died away, not to return; but from time to time Rudolf
      hummed softly a cheerful tune, his fingers beating time on Bauer&rsquo;s captive
      arm. Presently they crossed the road. Bauer&rsquo;s lagging steps indicated that
      he took no pleasure in the change of side, but he could not resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, you shall go where I am going, my lad,&rdquo; said Rudolf encouragingly;
      and he laughed a little as he looked down at the fellow&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along they went; soon they came to the small numbers at the station end of
      the Konigstrasse. Rudolf began to peer up at the shop fronts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cursed dark,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Pray, lad, can you make out which is
      nineteen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment he had spoken the smile broadened on his face. The shot had
      gone home. Bauer was a clever scoundrel, but his nerves were not under
      perfect control, and his arm had quivered under Rudolf&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nineteen, sir?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, nineteen. That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re bound for, you and I. There I hope we
      shall find&mdash;what we want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bauer seemed bewildered: no doubt he was at a loss how either to
      understand or to parry the bold attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, this looks like it,&rdquo; said Rudolf, in a tone of great satisfaction, as
      they came to old Mother Holf&rsquo;s little shop. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a one and a nine
      over the door, my lad? Ah, and Holf! Yes, that&rsquo;s the name. Pray ring the
      bell. My hands are occupied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf&rsquo;s hands were indeed occupied; one held Bauer&rsquo;s arm, now no longer
      with a friendly pressure, but with a grip of iron; in the other the
      captive saw the revolver that had till now lain hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see?&rdquo; asked Rudolf pleasantly. &ldquo;You must ring for me, mustn&rsquo;t you? It
      would startle them if I roused them with a shot.&rdquo; A motion of the barrel
      told Bauer the direction which the shot would take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bell,&rdquo; said Bauer sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then you knock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any particular way, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; growled Bauer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I. Can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know nothing of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must try. You knock, and&mdash;Listen, my lad. You must guess
      right. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I guess?&rdquo; asked Bauer, in an attempt at bluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; smiled Rudolf. &ldquo;But I hate waiting, and if the
      door is not open in two minutes, I shall arouse the good folk with a shot.
      You see? You quite see, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Again the barrel&rsquo;s motion pointed and
      explained Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this powerful persuasion Bauer yielded. He lifted his hand and
      knocked on the door with his knuckles, first loudly, then very softly, the
      gentler stroke being repeated five times in rapid succession. Clearly he
      was expected, for without any sound of approaching feet the chain was
      unfastened with a subdued rattle. Then came the noise of the bolt being
      cautiously worked back into its socket. As it shot home a chink of the
      door opened. At the same moment Rudolf&rsquo;s hand slipped from Bauer&rsquo;s arm.
      With a swift movement he caught the fellow by the nape of the neck and
      flung him violently forward into the roadway, where, losing his footing,
      he fell sprawling face downwards in the mud. Rudolf threw himself against
      the door: it yielded, he was inside, and in an instant he had shut the
      door and driven the bolt home again, leaving Bauer in the gutter outside.
      Then he turned, with his hand on the butt of his revolver. I know that he
      hoped to find Rupert of Hentzau&rsquo;s face within a foot of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Rupert nor Rischenheim, nor even the old woman fronted him: a
      tall, handsome, dark girl faced him, holding an oil-lamp in her hand. He
      did not know her, but I could have told him that she was old Mother Holf&rsquo;s
      youngest child, Rosa, for I had often seen her as I rode through the town
      of Zenda with the king, before the old lady moved her dwelling to
      Strelsau. Indeed the girl had seemed to haunt the king&rsquo;s foot-steps, and
      he had himself joked on her obvious efforts to attract his attention, and
      the languishing glances of her great black eyes. But it is the lot of
      prominent personages to inspire these strange passions, and the king had
      spent as little thought on her as on any of the romantic girls who found a
      naughty delight in half-fanciful devotion to him&mdash;devotion starting,
      in many cases, by an irony of which the king was happily unconscious, from
      the brave figure that he made at his coronation and his picturesque daring
      in the affair of Black Michael. The worshipers never came near enough to
      perceive the alteration in their idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half then, at least, of Rosa&rsquo;s attachment was justly due to the man
      who now stood opposite to her, looking at her with surprise by the murky
      light of the strong-smelling oil-lamp. The lamp shook and almost fell from
      her hand when she saw him; for the scarf had slid away, and his features
      were exposed to full view. Fright, delight, and excitement vied with one
      another in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king!&rdquo; she whispered in amazement. &ldquo;No, but&mdash;&rdquo; And she searched
      his face wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the beard you miss?&rdquo; asked Rudolf, fingering his chin. &ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t
      kings shave when they please, as well as other men?&rdquo; Her face still
      expressed bewilderment, and still a lingering doubt. He bent towards her,
      whispering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I wasn&rsquo;t over-anxious to be known at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed with pleasure at the confidence he seemed to put in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should know you anywhere,&rdquo; she whispered, with a glance of the great
      black eyes. &ldquo;Anywhere, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll help me, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear young lady, merely with a little information. Whose home
      is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! She takes lodgers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl appeared vexed at his cautious approaches. &ldquo;Tell me what you want
      to know,&rdquo; she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying on the bed moaning and swearing, because his wounded arm gives
      him pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is nobody else here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked round warily, and sank her voice to a whisper as she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not now&mdash;nobody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was seeking a friend of mine,&rdquo; said Rudolf. &ldquo;I want to see him alone.
      It&rsquo;s not easy for a king to see people alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know whom I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. No, he&rsquo;s gone; but he&rsquo;s gone to find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To find me! Plague take it! How do you know that, my pretty lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bauer told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Bauer! And who&rsquo;s Bauer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who knocked. Why did you shut him out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be alone with you, to be sure. So Bauer tells you his master&rsquo;s
      secrets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She acknowledged his raillery with a coquettish laugh. It was not amiss
      for the king to see that she had her admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and where has this foolish count gone to meet me?&rdquo; asked Rudolf
      lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I came straight from the Castle of Zenda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;he expected to find you at the hunting lodge. Ah, but
      now I recollect! The Count of Rischenheim was greatly vexed to find, on
      his return, that his cousin was gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, he was gone! Now I see! Rischenheim brought a message from me to
      Count Rupert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they missed one another, your Majesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, my dear young lady. Very vexatious it is, upon my word!&rdquo; In this
      remark, at least, Rudolf spoke no more and no other than he felt. &ldquo;But
      when do you expect the Count of Hentzau?&rdquo; he pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early in the morning, your Majesty&mdash;at seven or eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf came nearer to her, and took a couple of gold coins from his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want money, your Majesty,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, make a hole in them and hang them round your neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes: yes, give them to me,&rdquo; she cried, holding out her hand eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll earn them?&rdquo; he asked, playfully holding them out of her reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By being ready to open to me when I come at eleven and knock as Bauer
      knocked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by telling nobody that I&rsquo;ve been here to-night. Will you promise me
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him least of all. You must tell nobody. My business is very private, and
      Rischenheim doesn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do all you tell me. But&mdash;but Bauer knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Rudolf. &ldquo;Bauer knows. Well, we&rsquo;ll see about Bauer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he turned towards the door. Suddenly the girl bent, snatched
      at his hand and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would die for you,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said he gently. I believe he was loath to make profit, even
      in the queen&rsquo;s service, of her poor foolish love. He laid his hand on the
      door, but paused a moment to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Bauer comes, you have told me nothing. Mind, nothing! I threatened
      you, but you told me nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tell them you have been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be helped; at least they won&rsquo;t know when I shall arrive again.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf opened the door and slipped through, closing it hastily behind him.
      If Bauer got back to the house, his visit must be known; but if he could
      intercept Bauer, the girl&rsquo;s silence was assured. He stood just outside,
      listening intently and searching the darkness with eager eyes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. WHAT THE CHANCELLOR&rsquo;S WIFE SAW
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE night, so precious in its silence, solitude, and darkness, was waning
      fast; soon the first dim approaches of day would be visible; soon the
      streets would become alive and people be about. Before then Rudolf
      Rassendyll, the man who bore a face that he dared not show in open day,
      must be under cover; else men would say that the king was in Strelsau, and
      the news would flash in a few hours through the kingdom and (so Rudolf
      feared) reach even those ears which we knew to be shut to all earthly
      sounds. But there was still some time at Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s disposal, and he
      could not spend it better than in pursuing his fight with Bauer. Taking a
      leaf out of the rascal&rsquo;s own book, he drew himself back into the shadow of
      the house walls and prepared to wait. At the worst he could keep the
      fellow from communicating with Rischenheim for a little longer, but his
      hope was that Bauer would steal back after a while and reconnoitre with a
      view to discovering how matters stood, whether the unwelcome visitor had
      taken his departure and the way to Rischenheim were open. Wrapping his
      scarf closely round his face, Rudolf waited, patiently enduring the tedium
      as he best might, drenched by the rain, which fell steadily, and very
      imperfectly sheltered from the buffeting of the wind. Minutes went by;
      there were no signs of Bauer nor of anybody else in the silent street. Yet
      Rudolf did not venture to leave his post; Bauer would seize the
      opportunity to slip in; perhaps Bauer had seen him come out, and was in
      his turn waiting till the coast should be clear; or, again, perhaps the
      useful spy had gone off to intercept Rupert of Hentzau, and warn him of
      the danger in the Konigstrasse. Ignorant of the truth and compelled to
      accept all these chances, Rudolf waited, still watching the distant
      beginnings of dawning day, which must soon drive him to his hiding-place
      again. Meanwhile my poor wife waited also, a prey to every fear that a
      woman&rsquo;s sensitive mind can imagine and feed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf turned his head this way and that, seeking always the darker blot
      of shadow that would mean a human being. For a while his search was vain,
      but presently he found what he looked for&mdash;ay, and even more. On the
      same side of the street, to his left hand, from the direction of the
      station, not one, but three blurred shapes moved up the street. They came
      stealthily, yet quickly; with caution, but without pause or hesitation.
      Rudolf, scenting danger, flattened himself close against the wall and felt
      for his revolver. Very likely they were only early workers or late
      revelers, but he was ready for something else; he had not yet sighted
      Bauer, and action was to be looked for from the man. By infinitely gradual
      sidelong slitherings he moved a few paces from the door of Mother Holf&rsquo;s
      house, and stood six feet perhaps, or eight, on the right-hand side of it.
      The three came on. He strained his eyes in the effort to discern their
      features. In that dim light certainty was impossible, but the one in the
      middle might well be Bauer: the height, the walk, and the make were much
      what Bauer&rsquo;s were. If it were Bauer, then Bauer had friends, and Bauer and
      his friends seemed to be stalking some game. Always most carefully and
      gradually Rudolf edged yet farther from the little shop. At a distance of
      some five yards he halted finally, drew out his revolver, covered the man
      whom he took to be Bauer, and thus waited his fortune and his chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it was plain that Bauer&mdash;for Bauer it was&mdash;would look for
      one of two things: what he hoped was to find Rudolf still in the house,
      what he feared was to be told that Rudolf, having fulfilled the unknown
      purpose of his visit, was gone whole and sound. If the latter tidings met
      him, these two good friends of his whom he had enlisted for his
      reinforcement were to have five crowns each and go home in peace; if the
      former, they were to do their work and make ten crowns. Years after, one
      of them told me the whole story without shame or reserve. What their work
      was, the heavy bludgeons they carried and the long knife that one of them
      had lent to Bauer showed pretty clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither to Bauer nor to them did it occur that their quarry might be
      crouching near, hunting as well as hunted. Not that the pair of ruffians
      who had been thus hired would have hesitated for that thought, as I
      imagine. For it is strange, yet certain, that the zenith of courage and
      the acme of villainy can alike be bought for the price of a lady&rsquo;s glove.
      Among such outcasts as those from whom Bauer drew his recruits the murder
      of a man is held serious only when the police are by, and death at the
      hands of him they seek to kill is no more than an every-day risk of their
      employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the house,&rdquo; whispered Bauer, stopping at the door. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll
      knock, and you stand by to knock him on the head if he runs out. He&rsquo;s got
      a six-shooter, so lose no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll only fire it in heaven,&rdquo; growled a hoarse, guttural voice that
      ended in a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo; objected the other auxiliary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I know where he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; answered Bauer. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A ruffian stood on either side of the door with uplifted bludgeon. Bauer
      raised his hand to knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf knew that Rischenheim was within, and he feared that Bauer, hearing
      that the stranger had gone, would take the opportunity of telling the
      count of his visit. The count would, in his turn, warn Rupert of Hentzau,
      and the work of catching the ringleader would all fall to be done again.
      At no time did Mr. Rassendyll take count of odds against him, but in this
      instance he may well have thought himself, with his revolver, a match for
      the three ruffians. At any rate, before Bauer had time to give the signal,
      he sprang out suddenly from the wall and darted at the fellow. His onset
      was so sudden that the other two fell back a pace; Rudolf caught Bauer
      fairly by the throat. I do not suppose that he meant to strangle him, but
      the anger, long stored in his heart, found vent in the fierce grip of his
      fingers. It is certain that Bauer thought his time was come, unless he
      struck a blow for himself. Instantly he raised his hand and thrust
      fiercely at Rudolf with his long knife. Mr. Rassendyll would have been a
      dead man, had he not loosed his hold and sprung lightly away. But Bauer
      sprang at him again, thrusting with the knife, and crying to his
      associates,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Club him, you fools, club him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus exhorted, one jumped forward. The moment for hesitation had gone. In
      spite of the noise of wind and pelting rain, the sound of a shot risked
      much; but not to fire was death. Rudolf fired full at Bauer: the fellow
      saw his intention and tried to leap behind one of his companions; he was
      just too late, and fell with a groan to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the other ruffians shrank back, appalled by the sudden ruthless
      decision of the act. Mr. Rassendyll laughed. A half smothered yet
      uncontrolled oath broke from one of them. &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely,
      gazing at Rudolf&rsquo;s face and letting his arm fall to his side. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he
      said then, and his mouth hung open. Again Rudolf laughed at his terrified
      stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bigger job than you fancied, is it?&rdquo; he asked, pushing his scarf well
      away from his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man gaped at him; the other&rsquo;s eyes asked wondering questions, but
      neither did he attempt to resume the attack. The first at last found
      voice, and he said, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;d be damned cheap at ten crowns, and that&rsquo;s
      the living truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friend&mdash;or confederate rather, for such men have no friends&mdash;looked
      on, still amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take up that fellow by his head and his heels,&rdquo; ordered Rudolf. &ldquo;Quickly!
      I suppose you don&rsquo;t want the police to find us here with him, do you?
      Well, no more do I. Lift him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke Rudolf turned to knock at the door of No. 19. But even as he
      did so Bauer groaned. Dead perhaps he ought to have been, but it seems to
      me that fate is always ready to take the cream and leave the scum. His
      leap aside had served him well, after all: he had nearly escaped scot
      free. As it was, the bullet, almost missing his head altogether, had just
      glanced on his temple as it passed; its impact had stunned, but not
      killed. Friend Bauer was in unusual luck that night; I wouldn&rsquo;t have taken
      a hundred to one about his chance of life. Rupert arrested his hand. It
      would not do to leave Bauer at the house, if Bauer were likely to regain
      speech. He stood for a moment, considering what to do, but in an instant
      the thoughts that he tried to gather were scattered again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The patrol! the patrol!&rdquo; hoarsely whispered the fellow who had not yet
      spoken. There was a sound of the hoofs of horses. Down the street from the
      station end there appeared two mounted men. Without a second moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation the two rascals dropped their friend Bauer with a thud on the
      ground; one ran at his full speed across the street, the other bolted no
      less quickly up the Konigstrasse. Neither could afford to meet the
      constables; and who could say what story this red-haired gentleman might
      tell, ay, or what powers he might command?
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in truth, Rudolf gave no thought to either his story or his powers.
      If he were caught, the best he could hope would be to lie in the lockup
      while Rupert played his game unmolested. The device that he had employed
      against the amazed ruffians could be used against lawful authority only as
      a last and desperate resort. While he could run, run he would. In an
      instant he also took to his heels, following the fellow who had darted up
      the Konigstrasse. But before he had gone very far, coming to a narrow
      turning, he shot down it; then he paused for a moment to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patrol had seen the sudden dispersal of the group, and, struck with
      natural suspicion, quickened pace. A few minutes brought them where Bauer
      was. They jumped from their horses and ran to him. He was unconscious, and
      could, of course, give them no account of how he came to be in his present
      state. The fronts of all the houses were dark, the doors shut; there was
      nothing to connect the man stretched on the ground with either No. 19 or
      any other dwelling. Moreover, the constables were not sure that the
      sufferer was himself a meritorious object, for his hand still held a long,
      ugly knife. They were perplexed: they were but two; there was a wounded
      man to look after; there were three men to pursue, and the three had fled
      in three separate directions. They looked up at No. 19; No. 19 remained
      dark, quiet, absolutely indifferent. The fugitives were out of sight.
      Rudolf Rassendyll, hearing nothing, had started again on his way. But a
      minute later he heard a shrill whistle. The patrol were summoning
      assistance; the man must be carried to the station, and a report made; but
      other constables might be warned of what had happened, and despatched in
      pursuit of the culprits. Rudolf heard more than one answering whistle; he
      broke into a run, looking for a turning on the left that would take him
      back into the direction of my house, but he found none. The narrow street
      twisted and curved in the bewildering way that characterizes the old parts
      of the town. Rudolf had spent some time once in Strelsau; but a king
      learns little of back streets, and he was soon fairly puzzled as to his
      whereabouts. Day was dawning, and he began to meet people here and there.
      He dared run no more, even had his breath lasted him; winding the scarf
      about his face, and cramming his hat over his forehead again, he fell into
      an easy walk, wondering whether he could venture to ask his way, relieved
      to find no signs that he was being pursued, trying to persuade himself
      that Bauer, though not dead, was at least incapable of embarrassing
      disclosures; above all, conscious of the danger of his tell-tale face, and
      of the necessity of finding some shelter before the city was all stirring
      and awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment he heard horses&rsquo; hoofs behind him. He was now at the end of
      the street, where it opened on the square in which the barracks stand. He
      knew his bearings now, and, had he not been interrupted, could have been
      back to safe shelter in my house in twenty minutes. But, looking back, he
      saw the figure of a mounted constable just coming into sight behind him.
      The man seemed to see Rudolf, for he broke into a quick trot. Mr.
      Rassendyll&rsquo;s position was critical; this fact alone accounts for the
      dangerous step into which he allowed himself to be forced. Here he was, a
      man unable to give account of himself, of remarkable appearance, and
      carrying a revolver, of which one barrel was discharged. And there was
      Bauer, a wounded man, shot by somebody with a revolver, a quarter of an
      hour before. Even to be questioned was dangerous; to be detained meant
      ruin to the great business that engaged his energies. For all he knew, the
      patrol had actually sighted him as he ran. His fears were not vain; for
      the constable raised his voice, crying, &ldquo;Hi, sir&mdash;you there&mdash;stop
      a minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Resistance was the one thing worse than to yield. Wit, and not force, must
      find escape this time. Rudolf stopped, looking round again with a
      surprised air. Then he drew himself up with an assumption of dignity, and
      waited for the constable. If that last card must be played, he would win
      the hand with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo; he asked coldly, when the man was a few yards
      from him; and, as he spoke, he withdrew the scarf almost entirely from his
      features, keeping it only over his chin. &ldquo;You call very peremptorily,&rdquo; he
      continued, staring contemptuously. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your business with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a violent start, the sergeant&mdash;for such the star on his collar
      and the lace on his cuff proclaimed him&mdash;leant forward in the saddle
      to look at the man whom he had hailed. Rudolf said nothing and did not
      move. The man&rsquo;s eyes studied his face intently. Then he sat bolt upright
      and saluted, his face dyed to a deep red in his sudden confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why do you salute me now?&rdquo; asked Rudolf in a mocking tone. &ldquo;First you
      hunt me, then you salute me. By Heaven, I don&rsquo;t know why you put yourself
      out at all about me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; the fellow stuttered. Then trying a fresh start, he
      stammered, &ldquo;Your Majesty, I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf stepped towards him with a quick, decisive tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why do you call me &lsquo;Your Majesty&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked, still mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it your Majesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf was close by him now, his hand on the horse&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up into the sergeant&rsquo;s face with steady eyes, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make a mistake, my friend. I am not the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not&mdash;?&rdquo; stuttered the bewildered fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means. And, sergeant&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A zealous officer, sergeant, can make no greater mistake than to take for
      the king a gentleman who is not the king. It might injure his prospects,
      since the king, not being here, mightn&rsquo;t wish to have it supposed that he
      was here. Do you follow me, sergeant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man said nothing, but stared hard. After a moment Rudolf continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such a case,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a discreet officer would not trouble the
      gentleman any more, and would be very careful not to mention that he had
      made such a silly mistake. Indeed, if questioned, he would answer without
      hesitation that he hadn&rsquo;t seen anybody even like the king, much less the
      king himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A doubtful, puzzled little smile spread under the sergeant&rsquo;s moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, the king is not even in Strelsau,&rdquo; said Rudolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in Strelsau, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, he&rsquo;s at Zenda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! At Zenda, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. It is therefore impossible&mdash;physically impossible&mdash;that
      he should be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fellow was convinced that he understood now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly impossible, sir,&rdquo; said he, smiling more broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely. And therefore impossible also that you should have seen him.&rdquo;
       With this Rudolf took a gold piece from his pocket and handed it to the
      sergeant. The fellow took it with something like a wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for you, you&rsquo;ve searched here and found nobody,&rdquo; concluded Mr.
      Rassendyll. &ldquo;So hadn&rsquo;t you better at once search somewhere else?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt, sir,&rdquo; said the sergeant, and with the most deferential
      salute, and another confidential smile, he turned and rode back by the way
      he had come. No doubt he wished that he could meet a gentleman who was&mdash;not
      the king&mdash;every morning of his life. It hardly need be said that all
      idea of connecting the gentleman with the crime committed in the
      Konigstrasse had vanished from his mind. Thus Rudolf won freedom from the
      man&rsquo;s interference, but at a dangerous cost&mdash;how dangerous he did not
      know. It was indeed most impossible that the king could be in Strelsau.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost no time now in turning his steps towards his refuge. It was past
      five o&rsquo;clock, day came quickly, and the streets began to be peopled by men
      and women on their way to open stalls or to buy in the market. Rudolf
      crossed the square at a rapid walk, for he was afraid of the soldiers who
      were gathering for early duty opposite to the barracks. Fortunately he
      passed by them unobserved, and gained the comparative seclusion of the
      street in which my house stands, without encountering any further
      difficulties. In truth, he was almost in safety; but bad luck was now to
      have its turn. When Mr. Rassendyll was no more than fifty yards from my
      door, a carriage suddenly drove up and stopped a few paces in front of
      him. The footman sprang down and opened the door. Two ladies got out; they
      were dressed in evening costume, and were returning from a ball. One was
      middle-aged, the other young and rather pretty. They stood for a moment on
      the pavement, the younger saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it pleasant, mother? I wish I could always be up at five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you wouldn&rsquo;t like it for long,&rdquo; answered the elder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very
      nice for a change, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped abruptly. Her eye had fallen on Rudolf Rassendyll. He knew
      her: she was no less a person than the wife of Helsing the chancellor; his
      was the house at which the carriage had stopped. The trick that had served
      with the sergeant of police would not do now. She knew the king too well
      to believe that she could be mistaken about him; she was too much of a
      busybody to be content to pretend that she was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; she whispered loudly, and, catching her daughter&rsquo;s arm,
      she murmured, &ldquo;Heavens, my dear, it&rsquo;s the king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf was caught. Not only the ladies, but their servants were looking at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flight was impossible. He walked by them. The ladies curtseyed, the
      servants bowed bare-headed. Rudolf touched his hat and bowed slightly in
      return. He walked straight on towards my house; they were watching him,
      and he knew it. Most heartily did he curse the untimely hours to which
      folks keep up their dancing, but he thought that a visit to my house would
      afford as plausible an excuse for his presence as any other. So he went
      on, surveyed by the wondering ladies, and by the servants who, smothering
      smiles, asked one another what brought his Majesty abroad in such a plight
      (for Rudolf&rsquo;s clothes were soaked and his boots muddy), at such an hour&mdash;and
      that in Strelsau, when all the world thought he was at Zenda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf reached my house. Knowing that he was watched he had abandoned all
      intention of giving the signal agreed on between my wife and himself and
      of making his way in through the window. Such a sight would indeed have
      given the excellent Baroness von Helsing matter for gossip! It was better
      to let every servant in my house see his open entrance. But, alas, virtue
      itself sometimes leads to ruin. My dearest Helga, sleepless and watchful
      in the interest of her mistress, was even now behind the shutter,
      listening with all her ears and peering through the chinks. No sooner did
      Rudolf&rsquo;s footsteps become audible than she cautiously unfastened the
      shutter, opened the window, put her pretty head out, and called softly:
      &ldquo;All&rsquo;s safe! Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mischief was done then, for the faces of Helsing&rsquo;s wife and daughter,
      ay, and the faces of Helsing&rsquo;s servants, were intent on this most strange
      spectacle. Rudolf, turning his head over his shoulder, saw them; a moment
      later poor Helga saw them also. Innocent and untrained in controlling her
      feelings, she gave a shrill little cry of dismay, and hastily drew back.
      Rudolf looked round again. The ladies had retreated to the cover of the
      porch, but he still saw their eager faces peering from between the pillars
      that supported it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may as well go in now,&rdquo; said Rudolf, and in he sprang. There was a
      merry smile on his face as he ran forward to meet Helga, who leant against
      the table, pale and agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They saw you?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said he. Then his sense of amusement conquered everything
      else, and he sat down in a chair, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give my life,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to hear the story that the chancellor will
      be waked up to hear in a minute or two from now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But a moment&rsquo;s thought made him grave again. For whether he were the king
      or Rudolf Rassendyll, he knew that my wife&rsquo;s name was in equal peril.
      Knowing this, he stood at nothing to serve her. He turned to her and spoke
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must rouse one of the servants at once. Send him round to the
      chancellor&rsquo;s and tell the chancellor to come here directly. No, write a
      note. Say the king has come by appointment to see Fritz on some private
      business, but that Fritz has not kept the appointment, and that the king
      must now see the chancellor at once. Say there&rsquo;s not a moment to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was looking at him with wondering eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I can impose on Helsing, I may stop those
      women&rsquo;s tongues? If nothing&rsquo;s done, how long do you suppose it&rsquo;ll be
      before all Strelsau knows that Fritz von Tarlenheim&rsquo;s wife let the king in
      at the window at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; murmured poor Helga in bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear lady, but for Heaven&rsquo;s sake do what I ask of you. It&rsquo;s the
      only chance now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; she said, and sat down to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that, hard on the marvelous tidings which, as I conjecture,
      the Baroness von Helsing poured into her husband&rsquo;s drowsy ears, came an
      imperative summons that the chancellor should wait on the king at the
      house of Fritz von Tarlenheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly we had tempted fate too far by bringing Rudolf Rassendyll again to
      Strelsau.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. BEFORE THEM ALL!
    </h2>
    <p>
      GREAT as was the risk and immense as were the difficulties created by the
      course which Mr. Rassendyll adopted, I cannot doubt that he acted for the
      best in the light of the information which he possessed. His plan was to
      disclose himself in the character of the king to Helsing, to bind him to
      secrecy, and make him impose the same obligation on his wife, daughter,
      and servants. The chancellor was to be quieted with the excuse of urgent
      business, and conciliated by a promise that he should know its nature in
      the course of a few hours; meanwhile an appeal to his loyalty must suffice
      to insure obedience. If all went well in the day that had now dawned, by
      the evening of it the letter would be destroyed, the queen&rsquo;s peril past,
      and Rudolf once more far away from Strelsau. Then enough of the truth&mdash;no
      more&mdash;must be disclosed. Helsing would be told the story of Rudolf
      Rassendyll and persuaded to hold his tongue about the harum-scarum
      Englishman (we are ready to believe much of an Englishman) having been
      audacious enough again to play the king in Strelsau. The old chancellor
      was a very good fellow, and I do not think that Rudolf did wrong in
      relying upon him. Where he miscalculated was, of course, just where he was
      ignorant. The whole of what the queen&rsquo;s friends, ay, and the queen
      herself, did in Strelsau, became useless and mischievous by reason of the
      king&rsquo;s death; their action must have been utterly different, had they been
      aware of that catastrophe; but their wisdom must be judged only according
      to their knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, the chancellor himself showed much good sense. Even
      before he obeyed the king&rsquo;s summons he sent for the two servants and
      charged them, on pain of instant dismissal and worse things to follow, to
      say nothing of what they had seen. His commands to his wife and daughter
      were more polite, doubtless, but no less peremptory. He may well have
      supposed that the king&rsquo;s business was private as well as important when it
      led his Majesty to be roaming the streets of Strelsau at a moment when he
      was supposed to be at the Castle of Zenda, and to enter a friend&rsquo;s house
      by the window at such untimely hours. The mere facts were eloquent of
      secrecy. Moreover, the king had shaved his beard&mdash;the ladies were
      sure of it&mdash;and this, again, though it might be merely an accidental
      coincidence, was also capable of signifying a very urgent desire to be
      unknown. So the chancellor, having given his orders, and being himself
      aflame with the liveliest curiosity, lost no time in obeying the king&rsquo;s
      commands, and arrived at my house before six o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the visitor was announced Rudolf was upstairs, having a bath and some
      breakfast. Helga had learnt her lesson well enough to entertain the
      visitor until Rudolf appeared. She was full of apologies for my absence,
      protesting that she could in no way explain it; neither could she so much
      as conjecture what was the king&rsquo;s business with her husband. She played
      the dutiful wife whose virtue was obedience, whose greatest sin would be
      an indiscreet prying into what it was not her part to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know no more,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;than that Fritz wrote to me to expect the
      king and him at about five o&rsquo;clock, and to be ready to let them in by the
      window, as the king did not wish the servants to be aware of his
      presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king came and greeted Helsing most graciously. The tragedy and comedy
      of these busy days were strangely mingled; even now I can hardly help
      smiling when I picture Rudolf, with grave lips, but that distant twinkle
      in his eye (I swear he enjoyed the sport), sitting down by the old
      chancellor in the darkest corner of the room, covering him with flattery,
      hinting at most strange things, deploring a secret obstacle to immediate
      confidence, promising that to-morrow, at latest, he would seek the advice
      of the wisest and most tried of his counselors, appealing to the
      chancellor&rsquo;s loyalty to trust him till then. Helsing, blinking through his
      spectacles, followed with devout attention the long narrative that told
      nothing, and the urgent exhortation that masked a trick. His accents were
      almost broken with emotion as he put himself absolutely at the king&rsquo;s
      disposal, and declared that he could answer for the discretion of his
      family and household as completely as for his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a very lucky man, my dear chancellor,&rdquo; said Rudolf, with a
      sigh which seemed to hint that the king in his palace was not so
      fortunate. Helsing was immensely pleased. He was all agog to go and tell
      his wife how entirely the king trusted to her honor and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing that Rudolf more desired than to be relieved of the
      excellent old fellow&rsquo;s presence; but, well aware of the supreme importance
      of keeping him in a good temper, he would not hear of his departure for a
      few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, the ladies won&rsquo;t talk till after breakfast, and since they
      got home only at five o&rsquo;clock they won&rsquo;t breakfast yet awhile,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he made Helsing sit down, and talked to him. Rudolf had not failed to
      notice that the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim had been a little surprised at
      the sound of his voice; in this conversation he studiously kept his tones
      low, affecting a certain weakness and huskiness such as he had detected in
      the king&rsquo;s utterances, as he listened behind the curtain in Sapt&rsquo;s room at
      the castle. The part was played as completely and triumphantly as in the
      old days when he ran the gauntlet of every eye in Strelsau. Yet if he had
      not taken such pains to conciliate old Helsing, but had let him depart, he
      might not have found himself driven to a greater and even more hazardous
      deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were conversing together alone. My wife had been prevailed on by
      Rudolf to lie down in her room for an hour. Sorely needing rest, she had
      obeyed him, having first given strict orders that no member of the
      household should enter the room where the two were except on an express
      summons. Fearing suspicion, she and Rudolf had agreed that it was better
      to rely on these injunctions than to lock the door again as they had the
      night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while these things passed at my house, the queen and Bernenstein were
      on their way to Strelsau. Perhaps, had Sapt been at Zenda, his powerful
      influence might have availed to check the impulsive expedition;
      Bernenstein had no such authority, and could only obey the queen&rsquo;s
      peremptory orders and pathetic prayers. Ever since Rudolf Rassendyll left
      her, three years before, she had lived in stern self-repression, never her
      true self, never for a moment able to be or to do what every hour her
      heart urged on her. How are these things done? I doubt if a man lives who
      could do them; but women live who do them. Now his sudden coming, and the
      train of stirring events that accompanied it, his danger and hers, his
      words and her enjoyment of his presence, had all worked together to
      shatter her self-control; and the strange dream, heightening the emotion
      which was its own cause, left her with no conscious desire save to be near
      Mr. Rassendyll, and scarcely with a fear except for his safety. As they
      journeyed her talk was all of his peril, never of the disaster which
      threatened herself, and which we were all striving with might and main to
      avert from her head. She traveled alone with Bernenstein, getting rid of
      the lady who attended her by some careless pretext, and she urged on him
      continually to bring her as speedily as might be to Mr. Rassendyll. I
      cannot find much blame for her. Rudolf stood for all the joy in her life,
      and Rudolf had gone to fight with the Count of Hentzau. What wonder that
      she saw him, as it were, dead? Yet still she would have it that, in his
      seeming death, all men hailed him for their king. Well, it was her love
      that crowned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they reached the city, she grew more composed, being persuaded by
      Bernenstein that nothing in her bearing must rouse suspicion. Yet she was
      none the less resolved to seek Mr. Rassendyll at once. In truth, she
      feared even then to find him dead, so strong was the hold of her dream on
      her; until she knew that he was alive she could not rest. Bernenstein,
      fearful that the strain would kill her, or rob her of reason, promised
      everything; and declared, with a confidence which he did not feel, that
      beyond doubt Mr. Rassendyll was alive and well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&mdash;where?&rdquo; she cried eagerly, with clasped hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re most likely, madam, to find him at Fritz von Tarlenheim&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
       answered the lieutenant. &ldquo;He would wait there till the time came to attack
      Rupert, or, if the thing is over, he will have returned there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us drive there at once,&rdquo; she urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernenstein, however, persuaded her to go to the palace first and let it
      be known there that she was going to pay a visit to my wife. She arrived
      at the palace at eight o&rsquo;clock, took a cup of chocolate, and then ordered
      her carriage. Bernenstein alone accompanied her when she set out for my
      house about nine. He was, by now, hardly less agitated than the queen
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her entire preoccupation with Mr. Rassendyll, she gave little thought
      to what might have happened at the hunting lodge; but Bernenstein drew
      gloomy auguries from the failure of Sapt and myself to return at the
      proper time. Either evil had befallen us, or the letter had reached the
      king before we arrived at the lodge; the probabilities seemed to him to be
      confined to these alternatives. Yet when he spoke in this strain to the
      queen, he could get from her nothing except, &ldquo;If we can find Mr.
      Rassendyll, he will tell us what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, then, a little after nine in the morning the queen&rsquo;s carriage drove
      up to my door. The ladies of the chancellor&rsquo;s family had enjoyed a very
      short night&rsquo;s rest, for their heads came bobbing out of window the moment
      the wheels were heard; many people were about now, and the crown on the
      panels attracted the usual small crowd of loiterers. Bernenstein sprang
      out and gave his hand to the queen. With a hasty slight bow to the
      onlookers, she hastened up the two or three steps of the porch, and with
      her own hand rang the bell. Inside, the carriage had just been observed.
      My wife&rsquo;s waiting-maid ran hastily to her mistress; Helga was lying on her
      bed; she rose at once, and after a few moments of necessary preparations
      (or such preparations as seem to ladies necessary, however great the need
      of haste may be) hurried downstairs to receive her Majesty&mdash;and to
      warn her Majesty. She was too late. The door was already open. The butler
      and the footman both had run to it, and thrown it open for the queen. As
      Helga reached the foot of the stairs, her Majesty was just entering the
      room where Rudolf was, the servants attending her, and Bernenstein
      standing behind, his helmet in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf and the chancellor had been continuing their conversation. To avoid
      the observations of passers-by (for the interior of the room is easy to
      see from the street), the blind had been drawn down, and the room was in
      deep shadow. They had heard the wheels, but neither of them dreamt that
      the visitor could be the queen. It was an utter surprise to them when,
      without their orders, the door was suddenly flung open. The chancellor,
      slow of movement, and not, if I may say it, over-quick of brain, sat in
      his corner for half a minute or more before he rose to his feet. On the
      other hand, Rudolf Rassendyll was the best part of the way across the room
      in an instant. Helga was at the door now, and she thrust her head round
      young Bernenstein&rsquo;s broad shoulders. Thus she saw what happened. The
      queen, forgetting the servants, and not observing Helsing&mdash;seeming
      indeed to stay for nothing, and to think of nothing, but to have her
      thoughts and heart filled with the sight of the man she loved and the
      knowledge of his safety&mdash;met him as he ran towards her, and, before
      Helga, or Bernenstein, or Rudolf himself, could stay her or conceive what
      she was about to do, caught both his hands in hers with an intense grasp,
      crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rudolf, you&rsquo;re safe! Thank God, oh, thank God!&rdquo; and she carried his hands
      to her lips and kissed them passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment of absolute silence followed, dictated in the servants by
      decorum, in the chancellor by consideration, in Helga and Bernenstein by
      utter consternation. Rudolf himself also was silent, but whether from
      bewilderment or an emotion answering to hers, I know not. Either it might
      well be. The stillness struck her. She looked up in his eyes; she looked
      round the room and saw Helsing, now bowing profoundly from the corner; she
      turned her head with a sudden frightened jerk, and glanced at my
      motionless deferential servants. Then it came upon her what she had done.
      She gave a quick gasp for breath, and her face, always pale, went white as
      marble. Her features set in a strange stiffness, and suddenly she reeled
      where she stood, and fell forward. Only Rudolf&rsquo;s hand bore her up. Thus
      for a moment, too short to reckon, they stood. Then he, a smile of great
      love and pity coming on his lips, drew her to him, and passing his arm
      about her waist, thus supported her. Then, smiling still, he looked down
      on her, and said in a low tone, yet distinct enough for all to hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is well, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My wife gripped Bernenstein&rsquo;s arm, and he turned to find her pale-faced
      too, with quivering lips and shining eyes. But the eyes had a message, and
      an urgent one, for him. He read it; he knew that it bade him second what
      Rudolf Rassendyll had done. He came forward and approached Rudolf; then he
      fell on one knee, and kissed Rudolf&rsquo;s left hand that was extended to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to see you, Lieutenant von Bernenstein,&rdquo; said Rudolf
      Rassendyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the thing was done, ruin averted, and safety secured.
      Everything had been at stake; that there was such a man as Rudolf
      Rassendyll might have been disclosed; that he had once filled the king&rsquo;s
      throne was a high secret which they were prepared to trust to Helsing
      under stress of necessity; but there remained something which must be
      hidden at all costs, and which the queen&rsquo;s passionate exclamation had
      threatened to expose. There was a Rudolf Rassendyll, and he had been king;
      but, more than all this, the queen loved him and he the queen. That could
      be told to none, not even to Helsing; for Helsing, though he would not
      gossip to the town, would yet hold himself bound to carry the matter to
      the king. So Rudolf chose to take any future difficulties rather than that
      present and certain disaster. Sooner than entail it on her he loved, he
      claimed for himself the place of her husband and the name of king. And
      she, clutching at the only chance that her act left, was content to have
      it so. It may be that for an instant her weary, tortured brain found sweet
      rest in the dim dream that so it was, for she let her head lie there on
      his breast and her eyes closed, her face looking very peaceful, and a soft
      little sigh escaping in pleasure from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      But every moment bore its peril and exacted its effort. Rudolf led the
      queen to a couch, and then briefly charged the servants not to speak of
      his presence for a few hours. As they had no doubt perceived, said he,
      from the queen&rsquo;s agitation, important business was on foot; it demanded
      his presence in Strelsau, but required also that his presence should not
      be known. A short time would free them from the obligation which he now
      asked of their loyalty. When they had withdrawn, bowing obedience, he
      turned to Helsing, pressed his hand warmly, reiterated his request for
      silence, and said that he would summon the chancellor to his presence
      again later in the day, either where he was or at the palace. Then he bade
      all withdraw and leave him alone for a little with the queen. He was
      obeyed; but Helsing had hardly left the house when Rudolf called
      Bernenstein back, and with him my wife. Helga hastened to the queen, who
      was still sorely agitated; Rudolf drew Bernenstein aside, and exchanged
      with him all their news. Mr. Rassendyll was much disturbed at finding that
      no tidings had come from Colonel Sapt and myself, but his apprehension was
      greatly increased on learning the untoward accident by which the king
      himself had been at the lodge the night before. Indeed, he was utterly in
      the dark; where the king was, where Rupert, where we were, he did not
      know. And he was here in Strelsau, known as the king to half a dozen
      people or more, protected only by their promises, liable at any moment to
      be exposed by the coming of the king himself, or even by a message from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, in face of all perplexities, perhaps even the more because of the
      darkness in which he was enveloped, Rudolf held firm to his purpose. There
      were two things that seemed plain. If Rupert had escaped the trap and was
      still alive with the letter on him, Rupert must be found; here was the
      first task. That accomplished, there remained for Rudolf himself nothing
      save to disappear as quietly and secretly as he had come, trusting that
      his presence could be concealed from the man whose name he had usurped.
      Nay, if need were, the king must be told that Rudolf Rassendyll had played
      a trick on the chancellor, and, having enjoyed his pleasure, was gone
      again. Everything could, in the last resort, be told, save that which
      touched the queen&rsquo;s honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the message which I despatched from the station at Hofbau
      reached my house. There was a knock at the door. Bernenstein opened it and
      took the telegram, which was addressed to my wife. I had written all that
      I dared to trust to such a means of communication, and here it is:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to Strelsau. The king will not leave the lodge to-day. The
      count came, but left before we arrived. I do not know whether he has gone
      to Strelsau. He gave no news to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they didn&rsquo;t get him!&rdquo; cried Bernenstein in deep disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but he gave no news to the king,&rdquo; said Rudolf triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all standing now round the queen, who sat on the couch. She
      seemed very faint and weary, but at peace. It was enough for her that
      Rudolf fought and planned for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And see this,&rdquo; Rudolf went on. &ldquo;&lsquo;The king will not leave the lodge
      to-day.&rsquo; Thank God, then, we have to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but where&rsquo;s Rupert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall know in an hour, if he&rsquo;s in Strelsau,&rdquo; and Mr. Rassendyll looked
      as though it would please him well to find Rupert in Strelsau. &ldquo;Yes, I
      must seek him. I shall stand at nothing to find him. If I can only get to
      him as the king, then I&rsquo;ll be the king. We have to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My message put them in heart again, although it left so much still
      unexplained. Rudolf turned to the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, my queen,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;A few hours now will see an end of all our
      dangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be safe and at rest,&rdquo; said he, bending over her and speaking
      softly. &ldquo;And I shall be proud in the knowledge of having saved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; Helga heard him whisper as he bent lower still, and she and
      Bernenstein moved away.

      CHAPTER XIII. A KING UP HIS SLEEVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tall handsome girl was taking down the shutters from the shop front at
      No. 19 in the Konigstrasse. She went about her work languidly enough, but
      there was a tinge of dusky red on her cheeks and her eyes were brightened
      by some suppressed excitement. Old Mother Holf, leaning against the
      counter, was grumbling angrily because Bauer did not come. Now it was not
      likely that Bauer would come just yet, for he was still in the infirmary
      attached to the police-cells, where a couple of doctors were very busy
      setting him on his legs again. The old woman knew nothing of this, but
      only that he had gone the night before to reconnoitre; where he was to
      play the spy she did not know, on whom perhaps she guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure he never came back?&rdquo; she asked her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never came back that I saw,&rdquo; answered the girl. &ldquo;And I was on the
      watch with my lamp here in the shop till it grew light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s twelve hours gone now, and never a message! Ay, and Count Rupert
      should be here soon, and he&rsquo;ll be in a fine taking if Bauer&rsquo;s not back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl made no answer; she had finished her task and stood in the
      doorway, looking out on the street. It was past eight, and many people
      were about, still for the most part humble folk; the more comfortably
      placed would not be moving for an hour or two yet. In the road the traffic
      consisted chiefly of country carts and wagons, bringing in produce for the
      day&rsquo;s victualling of the great city. The girl watched the stream, but her
      thoughts were occupied with the stately gentleman who had come to her by
      night and asked a service of her. She had heard the revolver shot outside;
      as it sounded she had blown out her lamp, and there behind the door in the
      dark had heard the swiftly retreating feet of the fugitives and, a little
      later, the arrival of the patrol. Well, the patrol would not dare to touch
      the king; as for Bauer, let him be alive or dead: what cared she, who was
      the king&rsquo;s servant, able to help the king against his enemies? If Bauer
      were the king&rsquo;s enemy, right glad would she be to hear that the rogue was
      dead. How finely the king had caught him by the neck and thrown him out!
      She laughed to think how little her mother knew the company she had kept
      that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The row of country carts moved slowly by. One or two stopped before the
      shop, and the carters offered vegetables for sale. The old woman would
      have nothing to say to them, but waved them on irritably. Three had thus
      stopped and again proceeded, and an impatient grumble broke from the old
      lady as a fourth, a covered wagon, drew up before the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want anything: go on, go on with you!&rdquo; she cried shrilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carter got down from his seat without heeding her, and walked round to
      the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, sir,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Nineteen, Konigstrasse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A yawn was heard, and the long sigh a man gives as he stretches himself in
      the mingled luxury and pain of an awakening after sound refreshing sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;ll get down,&rdquo; came in answer from inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s the count!&rdquo; said the old lady to her daughter in satisfied
      tones. &ldquo;What will he say, though, about that rogue Bauer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert of Hentzau put his head out from under the wagon-tilt, looked up
      and down the street, gave the carter a couple of crowns, leapt down, and
      ran lightly across the pavement into the little shop. The wagon moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lucky thing I met him,&rdquo; said Rupert cheerily. &ldquo;The wagon hid me very
      well; and handsome as my face is, I can&rsquo;t let Strelsau enjoy too much of
      it just now. Well, mother, what cheer? And you, my pretty, how goes it
      with you?&rdquo; He carelessly brushed the girl&rsquo;s cheek with the glove that he
      had drawn off. &ldquo;Faith, though, I beg your pardon.&rdquo; he added a moment
      later, &ldquo;the glove&rsquo;s not clean enough for that,&rdquo; and he looked at his buff
      glove, which was stained with patches of dull rusty brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all as when you left, Count Rupert,&rdquo; said Mother Holf, &ldquo;except that
      that rascal Bauer went out last night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right enough. But hasn&rsquo;t he returned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum. No signs of&mdash;anybody else?&rdquo; His look defined the vague
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman shook her head. The girl turned away to hide a smile.
      &ldquo;Anybody else&rdquo; meant the king, so she suspected. Well, they should hear
      nothing from her. The king himself had charged her to be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Rischenheim has come, I suppose?&rdquo; pursued Rupert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; he came, my lord, soon after you went. He wears his arm in a
      sling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Rupert in sudden excitement. &ldquo;As I guessed! The devil! If only
      I could do everything myself, and not have to trust to fools and bunglers!
      Where&rsquo;s the count?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in the attic. You know the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. But I want some breakfast, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosa shall serve you at once, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl followed Rupert up the narrow crazy staircase of the tall old
      house. They passed three floors, all uninhabited; a last steep flight that
      brought them right under the deep arched roof. Rupert opened a door that
      stood at the top of the stairs, and, followed still by Rosa with her
      mysterious happy smile, entered a long narrow room. The ceiling, high in
      the centre, sloped rapidly down on either side, so that at door and window
      it was little more than six feet above the floor. There was an oak table
      and a few chairs; a couple of iron bedsteads stood by the wall near the
      window. One was empty; the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim lay on the other,
      fully dressed, his right arm supported in a sling of black silk. Rupert
      paused on the threshold, smiling at his cousin; the girl passed on to a
      high press or cupboard, and, opening it, took out plates, glasses, and the
      other furniture of the table. Rischenheim sprang up and ran across the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news?&rdquo; he cried eagerly. &ldquo;You escaped them, Rupert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears so,&rdquo; said Rupert airily; and, advancing into the room, he
      threw himself into a chair, tossing his hat on to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears that I escaped, although some fool&rsquo;s stupidity nearly made an
      end of me.&rdquo; Rischenheim flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about that directly,&rdquo; he said, glancing at the girl who had
      put some cold meat and a bottle of wine on the table, and was now
      completing the preparations for Rupert&rsquo;s meal in a very leisurely fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I nothing to do but to look at pretty faces&mdash;which, by Heaven, I
      wish heartily were the case&mdash;I would beg you to stay,&rdquo; said Rupert,
      rising and making her a profound bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no wish to hear what doesn&rsquo;t concern me,&rdquo; she retorted scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a rare and blessed disposition!&rdquo; said he, holding the door for her
      and bowing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I know,&rdquo; she cried to him triumphantly from the landing.
      &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d give something to know it too, Count Rupert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very likely, for, by Heaven, girls know wonderful things!&rdquo; smiled
      Rupert; but he shut the door and came quickly back to the table, now
      frowning again. &ldquo;Come, tell me, how did they make a fool of you, or why
      did you make a fool of me, cousin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Rischenheim related how he had been trapped and tricked at the
      Castle of Zenda, Rupert of Hentzau made a very good breakfast. He offered
      no interruption and no comments, but when Rudolf Rassendyll came into the
      story he looked up for an instant with a quick jerk of his head and a
      sudden light in his eyes. The end of Rischenheim&rsquo;s narrative found him
      tolerant and smiling again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, the snare was cleverly set,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you fell
      into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you? What happened to you?&rdquo; asked Rischenheim eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Why, having your message which was not your message, I obeyed your
      directions which were not your directions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went to the lodge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you found Sapt there?&mdash;Anybody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, not Sapt at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Sapt? But surely they laid a trap for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possibly, but the jaws didn&rsquo;t bite.&rdquo; Rupert crossed his legs and lit
      a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did you find?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I found the king&rsquo;s forester, and the king&rsquo;s boar-hound, and&mdash;well,
      I found the king himself, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king at the lodge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t so wrong as you thought, were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely Sapt, or Bernenstein, or some one was with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I tell you, his forester and his boar-hound. No other man or beast, on
      my honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you gave him the letter?&rdquo; cried Rischenheim, trembling with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, no, my dear cousin. I threw the box at him, but I don&rsquo;t think he
      had time to open it. We didn&rsquo;t get to that stage of the conversation at
      which I had intended to produce the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not&mdash;why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert rose to his feet, and, coming just opposite to where Rischenheim
      sat, balanced himself on his heels, and looked down at his cousin, blowing
      the ash from his cigarette and smiling pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that my coat&rsquo;s torn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The boar-hound tried to bite me, cousin. And the forester would have
      stabbed me. And&mdash;well, the king wanted to shoot me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! For God&rsquo;s sake, what happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they none of them did what they wanted. That&rsquo;s what happened, dear
      cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim was staring at him now with wide-opened eyes. Rupert smiled
      down on him composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, you see,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;Heaven helped me. So that, my dear cousin,
      the dog will bite no more, and the forester will stab no more. Surely the
      country is well rid of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed. Then Rischenheim, leaning forward, said in a low
      whisper, as though afraid to hear his own question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king? Well, the king will shoot no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Rischenheim, still leaning forward, gazed at his cousin. Then
      he sank slowly back into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he murmured: &ldquo;my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king was a fool,&rdquo; said Rupert. &ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll tell you a little more
      about it.&rdquo; He drew a chair up and seated himself in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he talked Rischenheim seemed hardly to listen. The story gained in
      effect from the contrast of Rupert&rsquo;s airy telling; his companion&rsquo;s pale
      face and twitching hands tickled his fancy to more shameless jesting. But
      when he had finished, he gave a pull to his small smartly-curled moustache
      and said with a sudden gravity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, though, it&rsquo;s a serious matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim was appalled at the issue. His cousin&rsquo;s influence had been
      strong enough to lead him into the affair of the letter; he was aghast to
      think how Rupert&rsquo;s reckless dare-deviltry had led on from stage to stage
      till the death of a king seemed but an incident in his schemes. He sprang
      suddenly to his feet, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must fly&mdash;we must fly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we needn&rsquo;t fly. Perhaps we&rsquo;d better go, but we needn&rsquo;t fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when it becomes known?&rdquo; He broke off and then cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you tell me? Why did you come back here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I told you because it was interesting, and I came back here because
      I had no money to go elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have sent money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find that I get more when I ask in person. Besides, is everything
      finished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no more to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear cousin, you despond too soon. The good king has unhappily
      gone from us, but we still have our dear queen. We have also, by the
      kindness of Heaven, our dear queen&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no more to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your neck feeling&mdash;?&rdquo; Rupert delicately imitated the putting of a
      noose about a man&rsquo;s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim rose suddenly and flung the window open wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m suffocated,&rdquo; he muttered with a sullen frown, avoiding Rupert&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Rudolf Rassendyll?&rdquo; asked Rupert. &ldquo;Have you heard of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must find that out, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim turned abruptly on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no hand in this thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll have no more to do with
      it. I was not there. What did I know of the king being there? I&rsquo;m not
      guilty of it: on my soul, I know nothing of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very true,&rdquo; nodded Rupert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rupert,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;let me go, let me alone. If you want money, I&rsquo;ll give
      it to you. For God&rsquo;s sake take it, and get out of Strelsau!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to beg, my dear cousin, but in fact I want a little money
      until I can contrive to realize my valuable property. Is it safe, I
      wonder? Ah, yes, here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew from his inner pocket the queen&rsquo;s letter. &ldquo;Now if the king hadn&rsquo;t
      been a fool!&rdquo; he murmured regretfully, as he regarded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he walked across to the window and looked out; he could not himself
      be seen from the street, and nobody was visible at the windows opposite.
      Men and women passed to and fro on their daily labors or pleasures; there
      was no unusual stir in the city. Looking over the roofs, Rupert could see
      the royal standard floating in the wind over the palace and the barracks.
      He took out his watch; Rischenheim imitated his action; it was ten minutes
      to ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rischenheim,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;come here a moment. Here&mdash;look out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim obeyed, and Rupert let him look for a minute or two before
      speaking again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see anything remarkable?&rdquo; he asked then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing,&rdquo; answered Rischenheim, still curt and sullen in his fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no more do I. And that&rsquo;s very odd. For don&rsquo;t you think that Sapt or
      some other of her Majesty&rsquo;s friends must have gone to the lodge last
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They meant to, I swear,&rdquo; said Rischenheim with sudden attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they would have found the king. There&rsquo;s a telegraph wire at Hofbau,
      only a few miles away. And it&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock. My cousin, why isn&rsquo;t Strelsau
      mourning for our lamented king? Why aren&rsquo;t the flags at half-mast? I don&rsquo;t
      understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; murmured Rischenheim, his eyes now fixed on his cousin&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert broke into a smile and tapped his teeth with his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said he meditatively, &ldquo;if that old player Sapt has got a king
      up his sleeve again! If that were so&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped and seemed to fall
      into deep thought. Rischenheim did not interrupt him, but stood looking
      now at him, now out of the window. Still there was no stir in the streets,
      and still the standards floated at the summit of the flag staffs. The
      king&rsquo;s death was not yet known in Strelsau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Bauer?&rdquo; asked Rupert suddenly. &ldquo;Where the plague can Bauer be? He
      was my eyes. Here we are, cooped up, and I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he is. Something must have happened to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, my wise cousin. But what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert began to pace up and down the room, smoking another cigarette at a
      great pace. Rischenheim sat down by the table, resting his head on his
      hand. He was wearied out by strain and excitement, his wounded arm pained
      him greatly, and he was full of horror and remorse at the event which
      happened unknown to him the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I was quit of it,&rdquo; he moaned at last. Rupert stopped before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You repent of your misdeeds?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Well, then, you shall be allowed
      to repent. Nay, you shall go and tell the king that you repent.
      Rischenheim, I must know what they are doing. You must go and ask an
      audience of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the king is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall know that better when you&rsquo;ve asked for your audience. See here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert sat down by his cousin and instructed him in his task. This was no
      other than to discover whether there were a king in Strelsau, or whether
      the only king lay dead in the hunting lodge. If there were no attempt
      being made to conceal the king&rsquo;s death, Rupert&rsquo;s plan was to seek safety
      in flight. He did not abandon his designs: from the secure vantage of
      foreign soil he would hold the queen&rsquo;s letter over her head, and by the
      threat of publishing it insure at once immunity for himself and almost any
      further terms which he chose to exact from her. If, on the other hand, the
      Count of Luzau-Rischenheim found a king in Strelsau, if the royal
      standards continued to wave at the summit of their flag staffs, and
      Strelsau knew nothing of the dead man in the lodge, then Rupert had laid
      his hand on another secret; for he knew who the king in Strelsau must be.
      Starting from this point, his audacious mind darted forward to new and
      bolder schemes. He could offer again to Rudolf Rassendyll what he had
      offered once before, three years ago&mdash;a partnership in crime and the
      profits of crime&mdash;or if this advance were refused, then he declared
      that he would himself descend openly into the streets of Strelsau and
      proclaim the death of the king from the steps of the cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can tell,&rdquo; he cried, springing up, enraptured and merry with the
      inspiration of his plan, &ldquo;who can tell whether Sapt or I came first to the
      lodge? Who found the king alive, Sapt or I? Who left him dead, Sapt or I?
      Who had most interest in killing him&mdash;I, who only sought to make him
      aware of what touched his honor, or Sapt, who was and is hand and glove
      with the man that now robs him of his name and usurps his place while his
      body is still warm? Ah, they haven&rsquo;t done with Rupert of Hentzau yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, looking down on his companion. Rischenheim&rsquo;s fingers still
      twitched nervously and his cheeks were pale. But now his face was alight
      with interest and eagerness. Again the fascination of Rupert&rsquo;s audacity
      and the infection of his courage caught on his kinsman&rsquo;s weaker nature,
      and inspired him to a temporary emulation of the will that dominated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; pursued Rupert, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not likely that they&rsquo;ll do you any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most gallant gentleman! At the worst they&rsquo;ll only keep you a prisoner.
      Well, if you&rsquo;re not back in a couple of hours, I shall draw my
      conclusions. I shall know that there&rsquo;s a king in Strelsau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where shall I look for the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, first in the palace, and secondly at Fritz von Tarlenheim&rsquo;s. I
      expect you&rsquo;ll find him at Fritz&rsquo;s, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go there first, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That would be seeming to know too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wait here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, cousin&mdash;unless I see cause to move, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall find you on my return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, or directions from me. By the way, bring money too. There&rsquo;s never any
      harm in having a full pocket. I wonder what the devil does without a
      breeches-pocket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim let that curious speculation alone, although he remembered the
      whimsical air with which Rupert delivered it. He was now on fire to be
      gone, his ill-balanced brain leaping from the depths of despondency to the
      certainty of brilliant success, and not heeding the gulf of danger that it
      surpassed in buoyant fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have them in a corner, Rupert,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, perhaps. But wild beasts in a corner bite hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish my arm were well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be safer with it wounded,&rdquo; said Rupert with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, Rupert, I can defend myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true; but it&rsquo;s your brain I want now, cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see that I have something in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it please God, dear cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With every mocking encouragement and every careless taunt Rischenheim&rsquo;s
      resolve to prove himself a man grew stronger. He snatched up a revolver
      that lay on the mantelpiece and put it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire, if you can help it,&rdquo; advised Rupert. Rischenheim&rsquo;s answer was
      to make for the door at a great speed. Rupert watched him go, and then
      returned to the window. The last his cousin saw was his figure standing
      straight and lithe against the light, while he looked out on the city.
      Still there was no stir in the streets, still the royal standard floated
      at the top of the flag staffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim plunged down the stairs: his feet were too slow for his
      eagerness. At the bottom he found the girl Rosa sweeping the passage with
      great apparent diligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going out, my lord?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; I have business. Pray stand on one side, this passage is so
      cursedly narrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosa showed no haste in moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Count Rupert, is he going out also?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see he&rsquo;s not with me. He&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo; Rischenheim broke off and asked
      angrily: &ldquo;What business is it of yours, girl? Get out of the way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved aside now, making him no answer. He rushed past; she looked
      after him with a smile of triumph. Then she fell again to her sweeping.
      The king had bidden her be ready at eleven. It was half-past ten. Soon the
      king would have need of her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. THE NEWS COMES TO STRELSAU
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON leaving No. 19, Rischenheim walked swiftly some little way up the
      Konigstrasse and then hailed a cab. He had hardly raised his hand when he
      heard his name called, and, looking round, saw Anton von Strofzin&rsquo;s smart
      phaeton pulling up beside him. Anton was driving, and on the other seat
      was a large nosegay of choice flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you off to?&rdquo; cried Anton, leaning forward with a gay smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where are you? To a lady&rsquo;s, I presume, from your bouquet there,&rdquo;
       answered Rischenheim as lightly as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little bunch of flowers,&rdquo; simpered young Anton, &ldquo;is a cousinly
      offering to Helga von Tarlenheim, and I&rsquo;m going to present it. Can I give
      you a lift anywhere?&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Rischenheim had intended to go first to the palace, Anton&rsquo;s offer
      seemed to give him a good excuse for drawing the more likely covert first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to the palace to find out where the king is. I want to see
      him, if he&rsquo;ll give me a minute or two,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive you there afterwards. Jump up. That your cab? Here you are,
      cabman,&rdquo; and flinging the cabman a crown, he displaced the bouquet and
      made room for Rischenheim beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anton&rsquo;s horses, of which he was not a little proud, made short work of the
      distance to my home. The phaeton rattled up to the door and both young men
      got out. The moment of their arrival found the chancellor just leaving to
      return to his own home. Helsing knew them both, and stopped to rally Anton
      on the matter of his bouquet. Anton was famous for his bouquets, which he
      distributed widely among the ladies of Strelsau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped it was for my daughter,&rdquo; said the chancellor slyly. &ldquo;For I love
      flowers, and my wife has ceased to provide me with them; moreover, I&rsquo;ve
      ceased to provide her with them, so, but for my daughter, we should have
      none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anton answered his chaff, promising a bouquet for the young lady the next
      day, but declaring that he could not disappoint his cousin. He was
      interrupted by Rischenheim, who, looking round on the group of bystanders,
      now grown numerous, exclaimed: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here, my dear chancellor?
      What are all these people hanging about here for? Ah, that&rsquo;s a royal
      carriage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen&rsquo;s with the countess,&rdquo; answered Helsing. &ldquo;The people are waiting
      to see her come out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always worth seeing,&rdquo; Anton pronounced, sticking his glass in his
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been to visit her?&rdquo; pursued Rischenheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. I&mdash;I went to pay my respects, my dear Rischenheim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An early visit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was more or less on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I have business also, and very important business. But it&rsquo;s with the
      king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you a moment, Rischenheim,&rdquo; called Anton, as, bouquet in
      hand, he knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the king?&rdquo; said Helsing. &ldquo;Ah, yes, but the king&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way to the palace to find out where he is. If I can&rsquo;t see him,
      I must write at once. My business is very urgent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, my dear count, indeed! Dear me! Urgent, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps you can help me. Is he at Zenda?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chancellor was becoming very embarrassed; Anton had disappeared into
      the house; Rischenheim buttonholed him resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Zenda? Well, now, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;Excuse me, but what&rsquo;s your business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, my dear chancellor; it&rsquo;s a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the king&rsquo;s confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be indifferent to not enjoying mine,&rdquo; smiled Rischenheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive that your arm is hurt,&rdquo; observed the chancellor, seeking a
      diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between ourselves, that has something to do with my business. Well, I
      must go to the palace. Or&mdash;stay&mdash;would her Majesty condescend to
      help me? I think I&rsquo;ll risk a request. She can but refuse,&rdquo; and so saying
      Rischenheim approached the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my friend, I wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; cried Helsing, darting after him.
      &ldquo;The queen is&mdash;well, very much engaged. She won&rsquo;t like to be
      troubled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim took no notice of him, but knocked loudly. The door was
      opened, and he told the butler to carry his name to the queen and beg a
      moment&rsquo;s speech with her. Helsing stood in perplexity on the step. The
      crowd was delighted with the coming of these great folk and showed no sign
      of dispersing. Anton von Strofzin did not reappear. Rischenheim edged
      himself inside the doorway and stood on the threshold of the hall. There
      he heard voices proceeding from the sitting-room on the left. He
      recognized the queen&rsquo;s, my wife&rsquo;s, and Anton&rsquo;s. Then came the butler&rsquo;s,
      saying, &ldquo;I will inform the count of your Majesty&rsquo;s wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of the room opened; the butler appeared, and immediately behind
      him Anton von Strofzin and Bernenstein. Bernenstein had the young fellow
      by the arm, and hurried him through the hall. They passed the butler, who
      made way for them, and came to where Rischenheim stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We meet again,&rdquo; said Rischenheim with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chancellor rubbed his hands in nervous perturbation. The butler
      stepped up and delivered his message: the queen regretted her inability to
      receive the count. Rischenheim nodded, and, standing so that the door
      could not be shut, asked Bernenstein whether he knew where the king was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Bernenstein was most anxious to get the pair of them away and the door
      shut, but he dared show no eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want another interview with the king already?&rdquo; he asked with a
      smile. &ldquo;The last was so pleasant, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim took no notice of the taunt, but observed sarcastically:
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a strange difficulty in finding our good king. The chancellor
      here doesn&rsquo;t know where he is, or at least he won&rsquo;t answer my questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly the king has his reasons for not wishing to be disturbed,&rdquo;
       suggested Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very possible,&rdquo; retorted Rischenheim significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, my dear count, I shall take it as a personal favor if you&rsquo;ll
      move out of the doorway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I incommode you by standing here?&rdquo; answered the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infinitely, my lord,&rdquo; answered Bernenstein stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Bernenstein, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Anton, seeing that their
      tones and glances had grown angry. The crowd also had noticed the raised
      voices and hostile manner of the disputants, and began to gather round in
      a more compact group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a voice came from inside the hall: it was distinct and loud, yet
      not without a touch of huskiness. The sound of it hushed the rising
      quarrel and silenced the crowd into expectant stillness. Bernenstein
      looked aghast, Rischenheim nervous yet triumphant, Anton amused and
      gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king!&rdquo; he cried, and burst into a laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve drawn him,
      Rischenheim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd heard his boyish exclamation and raised a cheer. Helsing turned,
      as though to rebuke them. Had not the king himself desired secrecy? Yes,
      but he who spoke as the king chose any risk sooner than let Rischenheim go
      back and warn Rupert of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim?&rdquo; called Rudolf from within. &ldquo;If
      so, let him enter and then shut the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in his tone that alarmed Rischenheim. He started back
      on the step. But Bernenstein caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you wish to come in, come in,&rdquo; he said with a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim looked round, as though he meditated flight. The next moment
      Bernenstein was thrust aside. For one short instant a tall figure appeared
      in the doorway; the crowd had but a glimpse, yet they cheered again.
      Rischenheim&rsquo;s hand was clasped in a firm grip; he passed unwillingly but
      helplessly through the door. Bernenstein followed; the door was shut.
      Anton faced round on Helsing, a scornful twist on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a deuced lot of mystery about nothing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t
      you say he was there?&rdquo; And without waiting for an answer from the outraged
      and bewildered chancellor he swung down the steps and climbed into his
      phaeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people round were chatting noisily, delighted to have caught a glimpse
      of the king, speculating what brought him and the queen to my house, and
      hoping that they would soon come out and get into the royal carriage that
      still stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had they been able to see inside the door, their emotion would have been
      stirred to a keener pitch. Rudolf himself caught Rischenheim by the arm,
      and without a moment&rsquo;s delay led him towards the back of the house. They
      went along a passage and reached a small room that looked out on the
      garden. Rudolf had known my house in old days, and did not forget its
      resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut the door, Bernenstein,&rdquo; said Rudolf. Then he turned to Rischenheim.
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose you came to find out something. Do you know
      it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim plucked up courage to answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know now that I have to deal with an impostor,&rdquo; said he defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. And impostors can&rsquo;t afford to be exposed.&rdquo; Rischenheim&rsquo;s cheek
      turned rather pale. Rudolf faced him, and Bernenstein guarded the door. He
      was absolutely at their mercy; and he knew their secret. Did they know his&mdash;the
      news that Rupert of Hentzau had brought?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Rudolf. &ldquo;For a few hours to-day I am king in Strelsau. In
      those few hours I have an account to settle with your cousin: something
      that he has, I must have. I&rsquo;m going now to seek him, and while I seek him
      you will stay here with Bernenstein. Perhaps I shall fail, perhaps I shall
      succeed. Whether I succeed or fail, by to-night I shall be far from
      Strelsau, and the king&rsquo;s place will be free for him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim gave a slight start, and a look of triumph spread over his
      face. They did not know that the king was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf came nearer to him, fixing his eyes steadily on his prisoner&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;why you are in this business, my lord. Your
      cousin&rsquo;s motives I know well. But I wonder that they seemed to you great
      enough to justify the ruin of an unhappy lady who is your queen. Be
      assured that I will die sooner than let that letter reach the king&rsquo;s
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim made him no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you armed?&rdquo; asked Rudolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim sullenly flung his revolver on the table. Bernenstein came
      forward and took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep him here, Bernenstein. When I return I&rsquo;ll tell you what more to do.
      If I don&rsquo;t return, Fritz will be here soon, and you and he must make your
      own plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t give me the slip a second time,&rdquo; said Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hold ourselves free,&rdquo; said Rudolf to Rischenheim, &ldquo;to do what we
      please with you, my lord. But I have no wish to cause your death, unless
      it be necessary. You will be wise to wait till your cousin&rsquo;s fate is
      decided before you attempt any further steps against us.&rdquo; And with a
      slight bow he left the prisoner in Bernenstein&rsquo;s charge, and went back to
      the room where the queen awaited him. Helga was with her. The queen sprang
      up to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t lose a moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All that crowd of people know now
      that the king is here. The news will filter through the town in no time.
      We must send word to Sapt to keep it from the king&rsquo;s ears at all costs: I
      must go and do my work, and then disappear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen stood facing him. Her eyes seemed to devour his face; but she
      said only: &ldquo;Yes, it must be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must return to the palace as soon as I am gone. I shall send out and
      ask the people to disperse, and then I must be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To seek Rupert of Hentzau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She struggled for a moment with the contending feelings that filled her
      heart. Then she came to him and seized hold of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she said in low trembling tones. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Rudolf. He&rsquo;ll kill
      you. Never mind the letter. Don&rsquo;t go: I had rather a thousand times that
      the king had it than that you should.... Oh, my dear, don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she began to implore him, but he would not yield. Helga moved
      towards the door, but Rudolf stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you must stay with her; you must go to the palace with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as he spoke they heard the wheels of a carriage driven quickly to the
      door. By now I had met Anton von Strofzin and heard from him that the king
      was at my house. As I dashed up the news was confirmed by the comments and
      jokes of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;s in a hurry,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s kept the king waiting. He&rsquo;ll get a
      wigging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As may be supposed, I paid little heed to them. I sprang out and ran up
      the steps to the door. I saw my wife&rsquo;s face at the window: she herself ran
      to the door and opened it for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;do all these people know he&rsquo;s here, and take him
      for the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t help it. He showed himself at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was worse than I dreamt: not two or three people, but all that crowd
      were victims of the mistake; all of them had heard that the king was in
      Strelsau&mdash;ay, and had seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he? Where is he?&rdquo; I asked, and followed her hastily to the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen and Rudolf were standing side by side. What I have told from
      Helga&rsquo;s description had just passed between them. Rudolf ran to meet me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all well?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I forgot the queen&rsquo;s presence and paid no sign of respect to her. I caught
      Rudolf by the arm and cried to him: &ldquo;Do they take you for the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Heavens, man, don&rsquo;t look so white! We shall manage it. I
      can be gone by to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone? How will that help, since they believe you to be the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can keep it from the king,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I can
      settle with Rupert and disappear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three were standing round me, surprised at my great and terrible
      agitation. Looking back now, I wonder that I could speak to them at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf tried again to reassure me. He little knew the cause of what he
      saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take long to settle affairs with Rupert,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And we must
      have the letter, or it will get to the king after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king will never see the letter,&rdquo; I blurted out, as I sank back in a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said nothing. I looked round on their faces. I had a strange feeling
      of helplessness, and seemed to be able to do nothing but throw the truth
      at them in blunt plainness. Let them make what they could of it, I could
      make nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king will never see the letter,&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Rupert himself has
      insured that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? You&rsquo;ve not met Rupert? You&rsquo;ve not got the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; but the king can never read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Rudolf seized me by the shoulder and fairly shook me; indeed I must
      have seemed like a man in a dream or a torpor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, man; why not?&rdquo; he asked in urgent low tones. Again I looked at
      them, but somehow this time my eyes were attracted and held by the queen&rsquo;s
      face. I believe that she was the first to catch a hint of the tidings I
      brought. Her lips were parted, and her gaze eagerly strained upon me. I
      rubbed my hand across my forehead, and, looking up stupidly at her, I
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never can see the letter. He&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little scream from Helga; Rudolf neither spoke nor moved; the
      queen continued to gaze at me in motionless wonder and horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rupert killed him,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The boar-hound attacked Rupert; then Herbert
      and the king attacked him; and he killed them all. Yes, the king is dead.
      He&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now none spoke. The queen&rsquo;s eyes never left my face. &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
       said I; and I watched her eyes still. For a long while (or long it seemed)
      they were on my face; at last, as though drawn by some irresistible force,
      they turned away. I followed the new line they took. She looked at Rudolf
      Rassendyll, and he at her. Helga had taken out her handkerchief, and,
      utterly upset by the horror and shock, was lying back in a low chair,
      sobbing half-hysterically; I saw the swift look that passed from the queen
      to her lover, carrying in it grief, remorse, and most unwilling joy. He
      did not speak to her, but put out his hand and took hers. She drew it away
      almost sharply, and covered her face with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf turned to me. &ldquo;When was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the.... He&rsquo;s at the lodge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with Sapt and James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was recovering my senses and my coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows yet,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We were afraid you might be taken for him by
      somebody. But, my God, Rudolf, what&rsquo;s to be done now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s lips were set firm and tight. He frowned slightly, and
      his blue eyes wore a curious entranced expression. He seemed to me to be
      forgetful of everything, even of us who were with him, in some one idea
      that possessed him. The queen herself came nearer to him and lightly
      touched his arm with her hand. He started as though surprised, then fell
      again into his reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done, Rudolf?&rdquo; I asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill Rupert of Hentzau,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The rest we&rsquo;ll talk of
      afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked rapidly across the room and rang the bell. &ldquo;Clear those people
      away,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Tell them that I want to be quiet. Then send a closed
      carriage round for me. Don&rsquo;t be more than ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant received his peremptory orders with a low bow, and left us.
      The queen, who had been all this time outwardly calm and composed, now
      fell into a great agitation, which even the consciousness of our presence
      could not enable her to hide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rudolf, must you go? Since&mdash;since this has happened&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, my dearest lady,&rdquo; he whispered. Then he went on more loudly, &ldquo;I
      won&rsquo;t quit Ruritania a second time leaving Rupert of Hentzau alive. Fritz,
      send word to Sapt that the king is in Strelsau&mdash;he will understand&mdash;and
      that instructions from the king will follow by midday. When I have killed
      Rupert, I shall visit the lodge on my way to the frontier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to go, but the queen, following, detained him for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come and see me before you go?&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I ought not,&rdquo; said he, his resolute eyes suddenly softening in a
      marvelous fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I sprang up, for a sudden dread laid hold on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, man,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;what if he kills you&mdash;there in the
      Konigstrasse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf turned to me; there was a look of surprise on his face. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
      kill me,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen, looking still in Rudolf&rsquo;s face, and forgetful now, as it
      seemed, of the dream that had so terrified her, took no notice of what I
      said, but urged again: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come, Rudolf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, once, my queen,&rdquo; and with a last kiss of her hand he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen stood for yet another moment where she was, still and almost
      rigid. Then suddenly she walked or stumbled to where my wife sat, and,
      flinging herself on her knees, hid her face in Helga&rsquo;s lap; I heard her
      sobs break out fast and tumultuously. Helga looked up at me, the tears
      streaming down her cheeks. I turned and went out. Perhaps Helga could
      comfort her; I prayed that God in His pity might send her comfort,
      although she for her sin&rsquo;s sake dared not ask it of Him. Poor soul! I hope
      there may be nothing worse scored to my account.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. A PASTIME FOR COLONEL SAPT
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE Constable of Zenda and James, Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s servant, sat at
      breakfast in the hunting-lodge. They were in the small room which was
      ordinarily used as the bedroom of the gentleman in attendance on the king:
      they chose it now because it commanded a view of the approach. The door of
      the house was securely fastened; they were prepared to refuse admission;
      in case refusal was impossible, the preparations for concealing the king&rsquo;s
      body and that of his huntsman Herbert were complete. Inquirers would be
      told that the king had ridden out with his huntsman at daybreak, promising
      to return in the evening but not stating where he was going; Sapt was
      under orders to await his return, and James was expecting instructions
      from his master the Count of Tarlenheim. Thus armed against discovery,
      they looked for news from me which should determine their future action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile there was an interval of enforced idleness. Sapt, his meal
      finished, puffed away at his great pipe; James, after much pressure, had
      consented to light a small black clay, and sat at his ease with his legs
      stretched before him. His brows were knit, and a curious half-smile played
      about his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What may you be thinking about, friend James?&rdquo; asked the constable
      between two puffs. He had taken a fancy to the alert, ready little fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      James smoked for a moment, and then took his pipe from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking, sir, that since the king is dead&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king is no doubt dead, poor fellow,&rdquo; said Sapt, nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That since he&rsquo;s certainly dead, and since my master, Mr. Rassendyll, is
      alive&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as we know, James,&rdquo; Sapt reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, sir, so far as we know. Since, then, Mr. Rassendyll is alive
      and the king is dead, I was thinking that it was a great pity, sir, that
      my master can&rsquo;t take his place and be king.&rdquo; James looked across at the
      constable with an air of a man who offers a respectful suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A remarkable thought, James,&rdquo; observed the constable with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t agree with me, sir?&rdquo; asked James deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that it isn&rsquo;t a pity, for Rudolf makes a good king. But you
      see it&rsquo;s impossible, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      James nursed his knee between his hands, and his pipe, which he had
      replaced, stuck out of one corner of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you say impossible, sir,&rdquo; he remarked deferentially, &ldquo;I venture to
      differ from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do? Come, we&rsquo;re at leisure. Let&rsquo;s hear how it would be possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master is in Strelsau, sir,&rdquo; began James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, most likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it, sir. If he&rsquo;s been there, he will be taken for the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has happened before, and no doubt may happen again, unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, sir, unless the king&rsquo;s body should be discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was about to say, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      James kept silence for a few minutes. Then he observed, &ldquo;It will be very
      awkward to explain how the king was killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story will need good telling,&rdquo; admitted Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it will be difficult to make it appear that the king was killed in
      Strelsau; yet if my master should chance to be killed in Strelsau&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid, James! On all grounds, Heaven forbid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if my master is not killed, it will be difficult for us to get the
      king killed at the right time, and by means that will seem plausible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt seemed to fall into the humor of the speculation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very
      true. But if Mr. Rassendyll is to be king, it will be both awkward and
      difficult to dispose of the king&rsquo;s body and of this poor fellow Herbert,&rdquo;
       said he, sucking at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again James paused for a little while before he remarked: &ldquo;I am, of
      course, sir, only discussing the matter by way of passing the time. It
      would probably be wrong to carry any such plan into effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be, but let us discuss it&mdash;to pass the time,&rdquo; said Sapt;
      and he leant forward, looking into the servant&rsquo;s quiet, shrewd face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, sir, since it amuses you, let us say that the king came to
      the lodge last night, and was joined there by his friend Mr. Rassendyll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did I come too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, sir, came also, in attendance on the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and you, James? You came. How came you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir, by the Count of Tarlenheim&rsquo;s orders, to wait on Mr. Rassendyll,
      the king&rsquo;s friend. Now, the king, sir... This is my story, you know, sir,
      only my story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your story interests me. Go on with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king went out very early this morning, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be on private business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we should have understood. But Mr. Rassendyll, Herbert, and ourselves
      remained here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had the Count of Hentzau been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to our knowledge, sir. But we were all tired and slept very soundly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now did we?&rdquo; said the constable, with a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, sir, we were all overcome with fatigue&mdash;Mr. Rassendyll like
      the rest&mdash;and full morning found us still in our beds. There we
      should be to this moment, sir, had we not been suddenly aroused in a
      startling and fearful manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should write story books, James. Now what was this fearful manner in
      which we were aroused?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      James laid down his pipe, and, resting his hands on his knees, continued
      his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lodge, sir, this wooden lodge&mdash;for the lodge is all of wood,
      sir, without and within.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lodge is undoubtedly of wood, James, and, as you say, both inside
      and out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And since it is, sir, it would be mighty careless to leave a candle
      burning where the oil and firewood are stored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most criminal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But hard words don&rsquo;t hurt dead men; and you see, sir, poor Herbert is
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. He wouldn&rsquo;t feel aggrieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we, sir, you and I, awaking&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t the others to awake, James?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir, I should pray that they had never awaked. For you and I,
      waking first, would find the lodge a mass of flames. We should have to run
      for our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Should we make no effort to rouse the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir, we should do all that men could do; we should even risk
      death by suffocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we should fail, in spite of our heroism, should we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, sir, in spite of all our efforts we should fail. The flames would
      envelop the lodge in one blaze; before help could come, the lodge would be
      in ruins, and my unhappy master and poor Herbert would be consumed to
      ashes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would, at least, sir, be entirely unrecognizable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond doubt, if the oil and the firewood and the candle were placed to
      the best advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes. And there would be an end of Rudolf Rassendyll?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I should myself carry the tidings to his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas the King of Ruritania&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would enjoy a long and prosperous reign, God willing, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Queen of Ruritania, James?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not misunderstand me, sir. They could be secretly married. I should
      say re-married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly, re-married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a trustworthy priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean by an untrustworthy priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same thing, sir, from a different point of view.&rdquo; For the first
      time James smiled a thoughtful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt in his turn laid down his pipe now, and was tugging at his moustache.
      There was a smile on his lips too, and his eyes looked hard into James&rsquo;s.
      The little man met his glance composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ingenious fancy, this of yours, James,&rdquo; the constable remarked.
      &ldquo;What, though, if your master&rsquo;s killed too? That&rsquo;s quite possible. Count
      Rupert&rsquo;s a man to be reckoned with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my master is killed, sir, he must be buried,&rdquo; answered James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Strelsau?&rdquo; came in quick question from Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t mind where, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, he won&rsquo;t mind, and we needn&rsquo;t mind for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, sir. But to carry a body secretly from here to Strelsau&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is, as we agreed at the first, difficult. Well, it&rsquo;s a pretty
      story, but&mdash;your master wouldn&rsquo;t approve of it. Supposing he were not
      killed, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a waste of time, sir, disapproving of what&rsquo;s done: he might think
      the story better than the truth, although it&rsquo;s not a good story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men&rsquo;s eyes met again in a long glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; asked Sapt, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London, sir, originally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They make good stories there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, and act them sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The instant he had spoken, James sprang to his feet and pointed out of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man on horseback was cantering towards the lodge. Exchanging one quick
      look, both hastened to the door, and, advancing some twenty yards, waited
      under the tree on the spot where Boris lay buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Sapt, &ldquo;you forgot the dog.&rdquo; And he pointed to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The affectionate beast will be in his master&rsquo;s room and die there, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, but he must rise again first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir. That won&rsquo;t be a long matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt was still smiling in grim amusement when the messenger came up and,
      leaning from his home, handed him a telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Special and urgent, sir,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt tore it open and read. It was the message that I sent in obedience to
      Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s orders. He would not trust my cipher, but, indeed, none
      was necessary. Sapt would understand the message, although it said simply,
      &ldquo;The king is in Strelsau. Wait orders at the lodge. Business here in
      progress, but not finished. Will wire again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt handed it to James, who took it with a respectful little bow. James
      read it with attention, and returned it with another bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to what it says, sir,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sapt. &ldquo;Thanks, my man,&rdquo; he added to the messenger. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a
      crown for you. If any other message comes for me and you bring it in good
      time, you shall have another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it quick as a horse can bring it from the station, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s business won&rsquo;t bear delay, you know,&rdquo; nodded Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have to wait, sir,&rdquo; and, with a parting salute, the fellow
      turned his horse and trotted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; remarked Sapt, &ldquo;that your story is quite imaginary. For that
      fellow can see for himself that the lodge was not burnt down last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true; but, excuse me, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray go on, James. I&rsquo;ve told you that I&rsquo;m interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t see that it won&rsquo;t be burnt down to-night. A fire, sir, is a
      thing that may happen any night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then old Sapt suddenly burst into a roar, half-speech, half laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, what a thing!&rdquo; he roared; and James smiled complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fate about it,&rdquo; said the constable. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a strange fate
      about it. The man was born to it. We&rsquo;d have done it before if Michael had
      throttled the king in that cellar, as I thought he would. Yes, by heavens,
      we&rsquo;d have done it! Why, we wanted it! God forgive us, in our hearts both
      Fritz and I wanted it. But Rudolf would have the king out. He would have
      him out, though he lost a throne&mdash;and what he wanted more&mdash;by
      it. But he would have him out. So he thwarted the fate. But it&rsquo;s not to be
      thwarted. Young Rupert may think this new affair is his doing. No, it&rsquo;s
      the fate using him. The fate brought Rudolf here again, the fate will have
      him king. Well, you stare at me. Do you think I&rsquo;m mad, Mr. Valet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir, that you talk very good sense, if I may say so,&rdquo; answered
      James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sense?&rdquo; echoed Sapt with a chuckle. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. But the
      fate&rsquo;s there, depend on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two were back in their little room now, past the door that hid the
      bodies of the king and his huntsman. James stood by the table, old Sapt
      roamed up and down, tugging his moustache, and now and again sawing the
      air with his sturdy hairy hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; he muttered: &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t do it. It&rsquo;s a thing a man can&rsquo;t
      set his hand to of his own will. But the fate&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;the fate&rsquo;ll
      do it. The fate&rsquo;ll force it on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d best be ready, sir,&rdquo; suggested James quietly. Sapt turned on
      him quickly, almost fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They used to call me a cool hand,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;By Jove, what are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no harm in being ready, sir,&rdquo; said James, the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt came to him and caught hold of his shoulders. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; he asked in a
      gruff whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The oil, the firewood, the light,&rdquo; said James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, man, where? Do you mean, by the bodies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not where the bodies are now. Each must be in the proper place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must move them then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. And the dog too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt almost glared at him; then he burst into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You take command. Yes, we&rsquo;ll be ready. The fate
      drives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then and there they set about what they had to do. It seemed indeed as
      though some strange influence were dominating Sapt; he went about the work
      like a man who is hardly awake. They placed the bodies each where the
      living man would be by night&mdash;the king in the guest-room, the
      huntsman in the sort of cupboard where the honest fellow had been wont to
      lie. They dug up the buried dog, Sapt chuckling convulsively, James grave
      as the mute whose grim doings he seemed to travesty: they carried the
      shot-pierced, earth-grimed thing in, and laid it in the king&rsquo;s room. Then
      they made their piles of wood, pouring the store of oil over them, and
      setting bottles of spirit near, that the flames having cracked the
      bottles, might gain fresh fuel. To Sapt it seemed now as if they played
      some foolish game that was to end with the playing, now as if they obeyed
      some mysterious power which kept its great purpose hidden from its
      instruments. Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s servant moved and arranged and ordered all
      as deftly as he folded his master&rsquo;s clothes or stropped his master&rsquo;s
      razor. Old Sapt stopped him once as he went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me a mad fool, because I talk of the fate,&rdquo; he said, almost
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, sir,&rdquo; answered James, &ldquo;I know nothing of that. But I like to be
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a thing!&rdquo; muttered Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mockery, real or assumed, in which they had begun their work, had
      vanished now. If they were not serious, they played at seriousness. If
      they entertained no intention such as their acts seemed to indicate, they
      could no longer deny that they had cherished a hope. They shrank, or at
      least Sapt shrank, from setting such a ball rolling; but they longed for
      the fate that would give it a kick, and they made smooth the incline down
      which it, when thus impelled, was to run. When they had finished their
      task and sat down again opposite to one another in the little front room,
      the whole scheme was ready, the preparations were made, all was in train;
      they waited only for that impulse from chance or fate which was to turn
      the servant&rsquo;s story into reality and action. And when the thing was done,
      Sapt&rsquo;s coolness, so rarely upset, yet so completely beaten by the force of
      that wild idea, came back to him. He lit his pipe again and lay back in
      his chair, puffing freely, with a meditative look on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s two o&rsquo;clock, sir,&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;Something should have happened
      before now in Strelsau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but what?&rdquo; asked the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly breaking on their ears came a loud knock at the door. Absorbed in
      their own thoughts, they had not noticed two men riding up to the lodge.
      The visitors wore the green and gold of the king&rsquo;s huntsmen; the one who
      had knocked was Simon, the chief huntsman, and brother of Herbert, who lay
      dead in the little room inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather dangerous!&rdquo; muttered the Constable of Zenda as he hurried to the
      door, James following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon was astonished when Sapt opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, Constable, but I want to see Herbert. Can I go in?&rdquo; And he
      jumped down from his horse, throwing the reins to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of your going in?&rdquo; asked Sapt. &ldquo;Herbert&rsquo;s not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here? Then where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he went with the king this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he went with the king, sir? Then he&rsquo;s in Strelsau, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know that, Simon, you&rsquo;re wiser than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the king is in Strelsau, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce he is! He said nothing of going to Strelsau. He rose early and
      rode off with Herbert, merely saying they would be back to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went to Strelsau, sir. I am just from Zenda, and his Majesty is known
      to have been in town with the queen. They were both at Count Fritz&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much interested to hear it. But didn&rsquo;t the telegram say where Herbert
      was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert&rsquo;s not a king, you see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll come again to-morrow
      morning, for I must see him soon. He&rsquo;ll be back by then, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Simon, your brother will be here to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or what&rsquo;s left of him after such a two-days of work,&rdquo; suggested Simon
      jocularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, precisely,&rdquo; said Sapt, biting his moustache and darting one
      swift glance at James. &ldquo;Or what&rsquo;s left of him, as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll bring a cart and carry the boar down to the castle at the same
      time, sir. At least, I suppose you haven&rsquo;t eaten it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt laughed; Simon was gratified at the tribute, and laughed even more
      heartily himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t even cooked it yet,&rdquo; said Sapt, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t answer for it
      that we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have by to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir; I&rsquo;ll be here. By the way, there&rsquo;s another bit of news
      come on the wires. They say Count Rupert of Hentzau has been seen in the
      city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rupert of Hentzau? Oh, pooh! Nonsense, my good Simon. He daren&rsquo;t show his
      face there for his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but it may be no nonsense. Perhaps that&rsquo;s what took the king to
      Strelsau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to take him if it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; admitted Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good day, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, Simon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two huntsmen rode off. James watched them for a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king,&rdquo; he said then, &ldquo;is known to be in Strelsau; and now Count
      Rupert is known to be in Strelsau. How is Count Rupert to have killed the
      king here in the forest of Zenda, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt looked at him almost apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the king&rsquo;s body to come to the forest of Zenda?&rdquo; asked James. &ldquo;Or
      how is the king&rsquo;s body to go to the city of Strelsau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop your damned riddles!&rdquo; roared Sapt. &ldquo;Man, are you bent on driving me
      into it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant came near to him, and laid a hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went into as great a thing once before, sir,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was to save the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is to save the queen and yourself. For if we don&rsquo;t do it, the
      truth about my master must be known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt made him no answer. They sat down again in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they sat, sometimes smoking, never speaking, while the tedious
      afternoon wore away, and the shadows from the trees of the forest
      lengthened. They did not think of eating or drinking; they did not move,
      save when James rose and lit a little fire of brushwood in the grate. It
      grew dusk and again James moved to light the lamp. It was hard on six
      o&rsquo;clock, and still no news came from Strelsau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was the sound of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs. The two rushed to the door,
      beyond it, and far along the grassy road that gave approach to the
      hunting-lodge. They forgot to guard the secret and the door gaped open
      behind them. Sapt ran as he had not run for many a day, and outstripped
      his companion. There was a message from Strelsau!
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable, without a word of greeting, snatched the envelope from the
      hand of the messenger and tore it open. He read it hastily, muttering
      under his breath &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; Then he turned suddenly round and began to
      walk quickly back to James, who, seeing himself beaten in the race, had
      dropped to a walk. But the messenger had his cares as well as the
      constable. If the constable&rsquo;s thoughts were on a crown, so were his. He
      called out in indignant protest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never drawn rein since Hofbau, sir. Am I not to have my crown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt stopped, turned, and retraced his steps. He took a crown from his
      pocket. As he looked up in giving it, there was a queer smile on his
      broad, weather-beaten face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;every man that deserves a crown shall have one, if I can
      give it him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned again to James, who had now come up, and laid his hand on
      his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, my king-maker,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      James looked in his face for a moment. The constable&rsquo;s eyes met his; and
      the constable nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they turned to the lodge where the dead king and his huntsman lay.
      Verily the fate drove.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. A CROWD IN THE KONIGSTRASSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The project that had taken shape in the thoughts of Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s
      servant, and had inflamed Sapt&rsquo;s daring mind as the dropping of a spark
      kindles dry shavings, had suggested itself vaguely to more than one of us
      in Strelsau. We did not indeed coolly face and plan it, as the little
      servant had, nor seize on it at once with an eagerness to be convinced of
      its necessity, like the Constable of Zenda; but it was there in my mind,
      sometimes figuring as a dread, sometimes as a hope, now seeming the one
      thing to be avoided, again the only resource against a more disastrous
      issue. I knew that it was in Bernenstein&rsquo;s thoughts no less than in my
      own; for neither of us had been able to form any reasonable scheme by
      which the living king, whom half Strelsau now knew to be in the city,
      could be spirited away, and the dead king set in his place. The change
      could take place, as it seemed, only in one way and at one cost: the
      truth, or the better part of it, must be told, and every tongue set
      wagging with gossip and guesses concerning Rudolf Rassendyll and his
      relations with the queen. Who that knows what men and women are would not
      have shrunk from that alternative? To adopt it was to expose the queen to
      all or nearly all the peril she had run by the loss of the letter. We
      indeed assumed, influenced by Rudolf&rsquo;s unhesitating self-confidence, that
      the letter would be won back, and the mouth of Rupert of Hentzau shut; but
      enough would remain to furnish material for eager talk and for conjectures
      unrestrained by respect or charity. Therefore, alive as we were to its
      difficulties and its unending risks, we yet conceived of the thing as
      possible, had it in our hearts, and hinted it to one another&mdash;my wife
      to me, I to Bernenstein, and he to me&mdash;in quick glances and half
      uttered sentences that declared its presence while shunning the open
      confession of it. For the queen herself I cannot speak. Her thoughts, as I
      judged them, were bounded by the longing to see Mr. Rassendyll again, and
      dwelt on the visit that he promised as the horizon of hope. To Rudolf we
      had dared to disclose nothing of the part our imaginations set him to
      play: if he were to accept it, the acceptance would be of his own act,
      because the fate that old Sapt talked of drove him, and on no persuasion
      of ours. As he had said, he left the rest, and had centered all his
      efforts on the immediate task which fell to his hand to perform, the task
      that was to be accomplished at the dingy old house in the Konigstrasse. We
      were indeed awake to the fact that even Rupert&rsquo;s death would not make the
      secret safe. Rischenheim, although for the moment a prisoner and helpless,
      was alive and could not be mewed up for ever; Bauer was we knew not where,
      free to act and free to talk. Yet in our hearts we feared none but Rupert,
      and the doubt was not whether we could do the thing so much as whether we
      should. For in moments of excitement and intense feeling a man makes light
      of obstacles which look large enough as he turns reflective eyes on them
      in the quiet of after-days.
    </p>
    <p>
      A message in the king&rsquo;s name had persuaded the best part of the idle crowd
      to disperse reluctantly. Rudolf himself had entered one of my carriages
      and driven off. He started not towards the Konigstrasse, but in the
      opposite direction: I supposed that he meant to approach his destination
      by a circuitous way, hoping to gain it without attracting notice. The
      queen&rsquo;s carriage was still before my door, for it had been arranged that
      she was to proceed to the palace and there await tidings. My wife and I
      were to accompany her; and I went to her now, where she sat alone, and
      asked if it were her pleasure to start at once. I found her thoughtful but
      calm. She listened to me; then, rising, she said, &ldquo;Yes, I will go.&rdquo; But
      then she asked suddenly, &ldquo;Where is the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her how Bernenstein kept guard over the count in the room at the
      back of the house. She seemed to consider for a moment, then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see him. Go and bring him to me. You must be here while I talk to
      him, but nobody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not know what she intended, but I saw no reason to oppose her
      wishes, and I was glad to find for her any means of employing this time of
      suspense. I obeyed her commands and brought Rischenheim to her. He
      followed me slowly and reluctantly; his unstable mind had again jumped
      from rashness to despondency: he was pale and uneasy, and, when he found
      himself in her presence, the bravado of his bearing, maintained before
      Bernenstein, gave place to a shamefaced sullenness. He could not meet the
      grave eyes that she fixed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I withdrew to the farther end of the room; but it was small, and I heard
      all that passed. I had my revolver ready to cover Rischenheim in case he
      should be moved to make a dash for liberty. But he was past that: Rupert&rsquo;s
      presence was a tonic that nerved him to effort and to confidence, but the
      force of the last dose was gone and the man was sunk again to his natural
      irresolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she began gently, motioning him to sit, &ldquo;I have desired to
      speak with you, because I do not wish a gentleman of your rank to think
      too much evil of his queen. Heaven has willed that my secret should be to
      you no secret, and therefore I may speak plainly. You may say my own shame
      should silence me; I speak to lessen my shame in your eyes, if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim looked up with a dull gaze, not understanding her mood. He had
      expected reproaches, and met low-voiced apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;it is because of me that the king lies dead now;
      and a faithful humble fellow also, caught in the net of my unhappy
      fortunes, has given his life for me, though he didn&rsquo;t know it. Even while
      we speak, it may be that a gentleman, not too old yet to learn nobility,
      may be killed in my quarrel; while another, whom I alone of all that know
      him may not praise, carries his life lightly in his hand for me. And to
      you, my lord, I have done the wrong of dressing a harsh deed in some cloak
      of excuse, making you seem to serve the king in working my punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim&rsquo;s eyes fell to the ground, and he twisted his hands nervously
      in and out, the one about the other. I took my hand from my revolver: he
      would not move now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she went on, now almost dreamily, and as though she spoke
      more to herself than to him, or had even forgotten his presence, &ldquo;what end
      in Heaven&rsquo;s counsel my great unhappiness has served. Perhaps I, who have
      place above most women, must also be tried above most; and in that trial I
      have failed. Yet, when I weigh my misery and my temptation, to my human
      eyes it seems that I have not failed greatly. My heart is not yet humbled,
      God&rsquo;s work not yet done. But the guilt of blood is on my soul&mdash;even
      the face of my dear love I can see now only through its scarlet mist; so
      that if what seemed my perfect joy were now granted me, it would come
      spoilt and stained and blotched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, fixing her eyes on him again; but he neither spoke nor moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew my sin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the sin so great in my heart; and you knew
      how little my acts yielded to it. Did you think, my lord, that the sin had
      no punishment, that you took it in hand to add shame to my suffering? Was
      Heaven so kind that men must temper its indulgence by their severity? Yet
      I know that because I was wrong, you, being wrong, might seem to yourself
      not wrong, and in aiding your kinsman might plead that you served the
      king&rsquo;s honor. Thus, my lord, I was the cause in you of a deed that your
      heart could not welcome nor your honor praise. I thank God that you have
      come to no more hurt by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim began to mutter in a low thick voice, his eyes still cast
      down: &ldquo;Rupert persuaded me. He said the king would be very grateful, and&mdash;would
      give me&mdash;&rdquo; His voice died away, and he sat silent again, twisting his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t have listened to such
      persuasions if my fault hadn&rsquo;t blinded your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned suddenly to me, who had been standing all the while aloof, and
      stretched out her hands towards me, her eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;your wife knows, and still loves me, Fritz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She should be no wife of mine, if she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;For I and all of
      mine ask no better than to die for your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows, and yet she loves me,&rdquo; repeated the queen. I loved to see that
      she seemed to find comfort in Helga&rsquo;s love. It is women to whom women
      turn, and women whom women fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Helga writes no letters,&rdquo; said the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said I, and I smiled a grim smile. Well, Rudolf Rassendyll had
      never wooed my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, saying: &ldquo;Come, let us go to the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she rose, Rischenheim made a quick impulsive step towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my lord,&rdquo; said she, turning towards him, &ldquo;will you also go with
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lieutenant von Bernenstein will take care&mdash;&rdquo; I began. But I stopped.
      The slightest gesture of her hand silenced me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go with me?&rdquo; she asked Rischenheim again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;Madam&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited. I waited also, although I had no great patience with him.
      Suddenly he fell on his knee, but he did not venture to take her hand. Of
      her own accord she came and stretched it out to him, saying sadly: &ldquo;Ah,
      that by forgiving I could win forgiveness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim caught at her hand and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not I,&rdquo; I heard him mutter. &ldquo;Rupert set me on, and I couldn&rsquo;t
      stand out against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go with me to the palace?&rdquo; she asked, drawing her hand away, but
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count of Luzau-Rischenheim,&rdquo; I made bold to observe, &ldquo;knows some
      things that most people do not know, madam.&rdquo; She turned on me with
      dignity, almost with displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count of Luzau-Rischenheim may be trusted to be silent,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;We ask him to do nothing against his cousin. We ask only his silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said I, braving her anger, &ldquo;but what security shall we have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His word of honor, my lord.&rdquo; I knew that a rebuke to my presumption lay
      in her calling me &ldquo;my lord,&rdquo; for, save on formal occasions, she always
      used to call me Fritz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His word of honor!&rdquo; I grumbled. &ldquo;In truth, madam&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Rischenheim; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; said the queen, smiling. &ldquo;The count will keep his word,
      given to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim looked at her and seemed about to address her, but then he
      turned to me, and said in a low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, I will, Tarlenheim. I&rsquo;ll serve her in everything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said she most graciously, and yet very sadly, &ldquo;you lighten the
      burden on me no less by your help than because I no longer feel your honor
      stained through me. Come, we will go to the palace.&rdquo; And she went to him,
      saying, &ldquo;We will go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for it but to trust him. I knew that I could not turn
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll see if the carriage is ready,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do, Fritz,&rdquo; said the queen. But as I passed she stopped me for a
      moment, saying in a whisper, &ldquo;Show that you trust him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went and held out my hand to him. He took and pressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my honor,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I went out and found Bernenstein sitting on a bench in the hall. The
      lieutenant was a diligent and watchful young man; he appeared to be
      examining his revolver with sedulous care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can put that away,&rdquo; said I rather peevishly&mdash;I had not fancied
      shaking hands with Rischenheim. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a prisoner any longer. He&rsquo;s one
      of us now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce he is!&rdquo; cried Bernenstein, springing to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him briefly what had happened, and how the queen had won Rupert&rsquo;s
      instrument to be her servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll stick to it,&rdquo; I ended; and I thought he would, though I
      was not eager for his help.
    </p>
    <p>
      A light gleamed in Bernenstein&rsquo;s eyes, and I felt a tremble in the hand
      that he laid on my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s only Bauer now,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;If Rischenheim&rsquo;s with us,
      only Bauer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew very well what he meant. With Rischenheim silent, Bauer was the
      only man, save Rupert himself, who knew the truth, the only man who
      threatened that great scheme which more and more filled our thoughts and
      grew upon us with an increasing force of attraction as every obstacle to
      it seemed to be cleared out of the way. But I would not look at
      Bernenstein, fearing to acknowledge even with my eyes how my mind jumped
      with his. He was bolder, or less scrupulous&mdash;which you will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if we can shut Bauer&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen&rsquo;s waiting for the carriage,&rdquo; I interrupted snappishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, of course, the carriage,&rdquo; and he twisted me round till I was
      forced to look him in the face. Then he smiled, and even laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only Bauer now!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Rupert,&rdquo; I remarked sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Rupert&rsquo;s dead bones by now,&rdquo; he chuckled, and with that he went out
      of the hall door and announced the queen&rsquo;s approach to her servants. It
      must be said for young Bernenstein that he was a cheerful
      fellow-conspirator. His equanimity almost matched Rudolf&rsquo;s own; I could
      not rival it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drove to the palace with the queen and my wife, the other two following
      in a second carriage. I do not know what they said to one another on the
      way, but Bernenstein was civil enough to his companion when I rejoined
      them. With us my wife was the principal speaker: she filled up, from what
      Rudolf had told her, the gaps in our knowledge of how he had spent his
      night in Strelsau, and by the time we arrived we were fully informed in
      every detail. The queen said little. The impulse which had dictated her
      appeal to Rischenheim and carried her through it seemed to have died away;
      she had become again subject to fears and apprehension. I saw her
      uneasiness when she suddenly put out her hand and touched mine,
      whispering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be at the house by now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our way did not lie by the house, and we came to the palace without any
      news of our absent chief (so I call him&mdash;as such we all, from the
      queen herself, then regarded him). She did not speak of him again; but her
      eyes seemed to follow me about as though she were silently asking some
      service of me; what it was I could not understand. Bernenstein had
      disappeared, and the repentant count with him: knowing they were together,
      I was in no uneasiness; Bernenstein would see that his companion contrived
      no treachery. But I was puzzled by the queen&rsquo;s tacit appeal. And I was
      myself on fire for news from the Konigstrasse. It was now two hours since
      Rudolf Rassendyll had left us, and no word had come of him or from him. At
      last I could bear it no longer. The queen was sitting with her hand in my
      wife&rsquo;s; I had been seated on the other side of the room, for I thought
      that they might wish to talk to one another; yet I had not seen them
      exchange a word. I rose abruptly and crossed the room to where they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you need of my presence, madam, or have I your permission to be away
      for a time?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you wish to go, Fritz?&rdquo; the queen asked with a little start, as
      though I had come suddenly across her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Konigstrasse,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise she rose and caught my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Fritz!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could have endured it
      longer. But I wouldn&rsquo;t ask you to go. But go, my dear friend, go and bring
      me news of him. Oh, Fritz, I seem to dream that dream again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My wife looked up at me with a brave smile and a trembling lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you go into the house, Fritz?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless I see need, sweetheart,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came and kissed me. &ldquo;Go, if you are wanted,&rdquo; she said. And she tried
      to smile at the queen, as though she risked me willingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have been such a wife, Fritz,&rdquo; whispered the queen. &ldquo;Yes, I
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had nothing to say; at the moment I might not have been able to say it
      if I had. There is something in the helpless courage of women that makes
      me feel soft. We can work and fight; they sit and wait. Yet they do not
      flinch. Now I know that if I had to sit and think about the thing I should
      turn cur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I went, leaving them there together. I put on plain clothes instead
      of my uniform, and dropped my revolver into the pocket of my coat. Thus
      prepared, I slipped out and made my way on foot to the Konigstrasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now long past midday, but many folks were at their dinner and the
      streets were not full. Two or three people recognized me, but I passed by
      almost unnoticed. There was no sign of stir or excitement, and the flags
      still floated high in the wind. Sapt had kept his secret; the men of
      Strelsau thought still that their king lived and was among them. I feared
      that Rudolf&rsquo;s coming would have been seen, and expected to find a crowd of
      people near the house. But when I reached it there were no more than ten
      or a dozen idle fellows lounging about. I began to stroll up and down with
      as careless an air as I could assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, however, there was a change. The workmen and business folk, their
      meal finished, began to come out of their houses and from the restaurants.
      The loafers before No. 19 spoke to many of them. Some said, &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
       shook their heads, smiled and passed on: they had no time to waste in
      staring at the king. But many waited; lighting their cigars or cigarettes
      or pipes, they stood gossiping with one another, looking at their watches
      now and again, lest they should overstay their leisure. Thus the assembly
      grew to the number of a couple of hundred. I ceased my walk, for the
      pavement was too crowded, and hung on the outskirts of the throng. As I
      loitered there, a cigar in my mouth, I felt a hand on my shoulder. Turning
      round, I saw the lieutenant. He was in uniform. By his side was
      Rischenheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here too, are you?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Well, nothing seems to be happening,
      does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For No. 19 showed no sign of life. The shutters were up, the door closed;
      the little shop was not open for business that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernenstein shook his head with a smile. His companion took no heed of my
      remark; he was evidently in a state of great agitation, and his eyes never
      left the door of the house. I was about to address him, when my attention
      was abruptly and completely diverted by a glimpse of a head, caught across
      the shoulders of the bystanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow whom I saw wore a brown wide-awake hat. The hat was pulled down
      low over his forehead, but nevertheless beneath its rim there appeared a
      white bandage running round his head. I could not see the face, but the
      bullet-shaped skull was very familiar to me. I was sure from the first
      moment that the bandaged man was Bauer. Saying nothing to Bernenstein, I
      began to steal round outside the crowd. As I went, I heard somebody saying
      that it was all nonsense; the king was not there: what should the king do
      in such a house? The answer was a reference to one of the first loungers;
      he replied that he did not know what the devil the king did there, but
      that the king or his double had certainly gone in, and had as certainly
      not yet come out again. I wished I could have made myself known to them
      and persuaded them to go away; but my presence would have outweighed my
      declarations, and been taken as a sure sign that the king was in the
      house. So I kept on the outskirts and worked my way unobtrusively towards
      the bandaged head. Evidently Bauer&rsquo;s hurt had not been so serious as to
      prevent him leaving the infirmary to which the police had carried him: he
      was come now to await, even as I was awaiting, the issue of Rudolf&rsquo;s visit
      to the house in the Konigstrasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not seen me, for he was looking at No. 19 as intently as
      Rischenheim. Apparently neither had caught sight of the other, or
      Rischenheim would have shown some embarrassment, Bauer some excitement. I
      wormed my way quickly towards my former servant. My mind was full of the
      idea of getting hold of him. I could not forget Bernenstein&rsquo;s remark,
      &ldquo;Only Bauer now!&rdquo; If I could secure Bauer we were safe. Safe in what? I
      did not answer to myself, but the old idea was working in me. Safe in our
      secret and safe in our plan&mdash;in the plan on which we all, we here in
      the city, and those two at the hunting-lodge, had set our minds! Bauer&rsquo;s
      death, Bauer&rsquo;s capture, Bauer&rsquo;s silence, however procured, would clear the
      greatest hindrance from its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bauer stared intently at the house; I crept cautiously up behind him. His
      hand was in his trousers&rsquo; pocket; where the curve of the elbow came there
      with a space between arm and body. I slipped in my left arm and hooked it
      firmly inside his. He turned round and saw me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus we meet again, Bauer,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was for a moment flabbergasted, and stared stupidly at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you also hoping to see the king?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to recover himself. A slow, cunning smile spread over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s in Strelsau, isn&rsquo;t he? Who gave you the wound on your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bauer moved his arm as though he meant to withdraw it from my grasp. He
      found himself tightly held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that bag of mine?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know what he would have answered, for at this instant there came
      a sound from behind the closed door of the house. It was as if some one
      ran rapidly and eagerly towards the door. Then came an oath in a shrill
      voice, a woman&rsquo;s voice, but harsh and rough. It was answered by an angry
      cry in a girl&rsquo;s intonation. Full of eagerness, I drew my arm from Bauer&rsquo;s
      and sprang forward. I heard a chuckle from him and turned round, to see
      his bandaged head retreating rapidly down the street. I had no time to
      look to him, for now I saw two men, shoulder to shoulder, making their way
      through the crowd, regardless of any one in their way, and paying no
      attention to abuse or remonstrances. They were the lieutenant and
      Rischenheim. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation I set myself to push and battle
      a way through, thinking to join them in front. On they went, and on I
      went. All gave place before us in surly reluctance or frightened
      willingness. We three were together in the first rank of the crowd when
      the door of the house was flung open, and a girl ran out. Her hair was
      disordered, her face pale, and her eyes full of alarm. There she stood on
      the doorstep, facing the crowd, which in an instant grew as if by magic to
      three times its former size, and, little knowing what she did, she cried
      in the eager accents of sheer terror:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help, help! The king! The king!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. YOUNG RUPERT AND THE PLAY-ACTOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      There rises often before my mind the picture of young Rupert, standing
      where Rischenheim left him, awaiting the return of his messenger and
      watching for some sign that should declare to Strelsau the death of its
      king which his own hand had wrought. His image is one that memory holds
      clear and distinct, though time may blur the shape of greater and better
      men, and the position in which he was that morning gives play enough to
      the imagination. Save for Rischenheim, a broken reed, and Bauer, who was
      gone, none knew where, he stood alone against a kingdom which he had
      robbed of its head, and a band of resolute men who would know no rest and
      no security so long as he lived. For protection he had only a quick brain,
      his courage, and his secret. Yet he could not fly&mdash;he was without
      resources till his cousin furnished them&mdash;and at any moment his
      opponents might find themselves able to declare the king&rsquo;s death and raise
      the city in hue and cry after him. Such men do not repent; but it may be
      that he regretted the enterprise which had led him on so far and forced on
      him a deed so momentous; yet to those who knew him it seems more likely
      that the smile broadened on his firm full lips as he looked down on the
      unconscious city. Well, I daresay he would have been too much for me, but
      I wish I had been the man to find him there. He would not have had it so;
      for I believe that he asked no better than to cross swords again with
      Rudolf Rassendyll and set his fortunes on the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down below, the old woman was cooking a stew for her dinner, now and then
      grumbling to herself that the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim was so long away,
      and Bauer, the rascal, drunk in some pot-house. The kitchen door stood
      open, and through it could be seen the girl Rosa, busily scrubbing the
      tiled floor; her color was high and her eyes bright; from time to time she
      paused in her task, and, raising her head, seemed to listen. The time at
      which the king needed her was past, but the king had not come. How little
      the old woman knew for whom she listened! All her talk had been of Bauer&mdash;why
      Bauer did not come and what could have befallen him. It was grand to hold
      the king&rsquo;s secret for him, and she would hold it with her life; for he had
      been kind and gracious to her, and he was her man of all the men in
      Strelsau. Bauer was a stumpy fellow; the Count of Hentzau was handsome,
      handsome as the devil; but the king was her man. And the king had trusted
      her; she would die before hurt should come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were wheels in the street&mdash;quick-rolling wheels. They seemed to
      stop a few doors away, then to roll on again past the house. The girl&rsquo;s
      head was raised; the old woman, engrossed in her stewing, took no heed.
      The girl&rsquo;s straining ear caught a rapid step outside. Then it came&mdash;the
      knock, the sharp knock followed by five light ones. The old woman heard
      now: dropping her spoon into the pot, she lifted the mess off the fire and
      turned round, saying: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the rogue at last! Open the door for him,
      Rosa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she spoke Rosa had darted down the passage. The door opened and
      shut again. The old woman waddled to the threshold of the kitchen. The
      passage and the shop were dark behind the closed shutters, but the figure
      by the girl&rsquo;s side was taller than Bauer&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; cried Mother Holf sharply. &ldquo;The shop&rsquo;s shut to-day: you
      can&rsquo;t come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am in,&rdquo; came the answer, and Rudolf stepped towards her. The girl
      followed a pace behind, her hands clasped and her eyes alight with
      excitement. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; asked Rudolf, standing opposite the old
      woman and smiling down on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, in the dim light of the low-roofed passage, Mother Holf was fairly
      puzzled. She knew the story of Mr. Rassendyll; she knew that he was again
      in Ruritania, it was no surprise to her that he should be in Strelsau; but
      she did not know that Rupert had killed the king, and she had not seen the
      king close at hand since his illness and his beard impaired what had been
      a perfect likeness. In fine, she could not tell whether it were indeed the
      king who spoke to her or his counterfeit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked, curt and blunt in her confusion. The girl broke
      in with an amused laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s the&mdash;&rdquo; She paused. Perhaps the king&rsquo;s identity was a
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf nodded to her. &ldquo;Tell her who I am,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mother, it&rsquo;s the king,&rdquo; whispered Rosa, laughing and blushing. &ldquo;The
      king, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, if the king&rsquo;s alive, I&rsquo;m the king,&rdquo; said Rudolf. I suppose he wanted
      to find out how much the old woman knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, but stared up at his face. In her bewilderment she
      forgot to ask how he had learnt the signal that gained him admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to see the Count of Hentzau,&rdquo; Rudolf continued. &ldquo;Take me to him
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman was across his path in a moment, all defiant, arms akimbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody can see the count. He&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; she blurted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, can&rsquo;t the king see him? Not even the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King!&rdquo; she cried, peering at him. &ldquo;Are you the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosa burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, you must have seen the king a hundred times,&rdquo; she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king, or his ghost&mdash;what does it matter?&rdquo; said Rudolf lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman drew back with an appearance of sudden alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His ghost? Is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His ghost!&rdquo; rang out in the girl&rsquo;s merry laugh. &ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s the king
      himself, mother. You don&rsquo;t look much like a ghost, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mother Holf&rsquo;s face was livid now, and her eyes staring fixedly. Perhaps it
      shot into her brain that something had happened to the king, and that this
      man had come because of it&mdash;this man who was indeed the image, and
      might have been the spirit, of the king. She leant against the door post,
      her broad bosom heaving under her scanty stuff gown. Yet still&mdash;was
      it not the king?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help us!&rdquo; she muttered in fear and bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He helps us, never fear,&rdquo; said Rudolf Rassendyll. &ldquo;Where is Count
      Rupert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl had caught alarm from her mother&rsquo;s agitation. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s upstairs in
      the attic at the top of the house, sir,&rdquo; she whispered in frightened
      tones, with a glance that fled from her mother&rsquo;s terrified face to
      Rudolf&rsquo;s set eyes and steady smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she said was enough for him. He slipped by the old woman and began to
      mount the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two watched him, Mother Holf as though fascinated, the girl alarmed
      but still triumphant: she had done what the king bade her. Rudolf turned
      the corner of the first landing and disappeared from their sight. The old
      woman, swearing and muttering, stumbled back into her kitchen, set her
      stew on the fire, and began to stir it, her eyes set on the flames and
      careless of the pot. The girl watched her mother for a moment, wondering
      how she could think of the stew, not guessing that she turned the spoon
      without a thought of what she did; then she began to crawl, quickly but
      noiselessly, up the staircase in the track of Rudolf Rassendyll. She
      looked back once: the old woman stirred with a monotonous circular
      movement of her fat arm. Rosa, bent half-double, skimmed upstairs, till
      she came in sight of the king whom she was so proud to serve. He was on
      the top landing now, outside the door of a large attic where Rupert of
      Hentzau was lodged. She saw him lay his hand on the latch of the door; his
      other hand rested in the pocket of his coat. From the room no sound came;
      Rupert may have heard the step outside and stood motionless to listen.
      Rudolf opened the door and walked in. The girl darted breathlessly up the
      remaining steps, and, coming to the door, just as it swung back on the
      latch, crouched down by it, listening to what passed within, catching
      glimpses of forms and movements through the chinks of the crazy hinge and
      the crevices where the wood of the panel sprung and left a narrow eye hole
      for her absorbed gazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupert of Hentzau had no thought of ghosts; the men he killed lay still
      where they fell, and slept where they were buried. And he had no wonder at
      the sight of Rudolf Rassendyll. It told him no more than that
      Rischenheim&rsquo;s errand had fallen out ill, at which he was not surprised,
      and that his old enemy was again in his path, at which (as I verily
      believe) he was more glad than sorry. As Rudolf entered, he had been
      half-way between window and table; he came forward to the table now, and
      stood leaning the points of two fingers on the unpolished dirty-white
      deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the play-actor!&rdquo; said he, with a gleam of his teeth and a toss of his
      curls, while his second hand, like Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s, rested in the pocket
      of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rassendyll himself has confessed that in old days it went against the
      grain with him when Rupert called him a play-actor. He was a little older
      now, and his temper more difficult to stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the play-actor,&rdquo; he answered, smiling. &ldquo;With a shorter part this
      time, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What part to-day? Isn&rsquo;t it the old one, the king with a pasteboard
      crown?&rdquo; asked Rupert, sitting down on the table. &ldquo;Faith, we shall do
      handsomely in Ruritania: you have a pasteboard crown, and I (humble man
      though I am) have given the other one a heavenly crown. What a brave show!
      But perhaps I tell you news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take no credit. It was more the dog&rsquo;s doing than mine,&rdquo; said Rupert
      carelessly. &ldquo;However, there it is, and dead he is, and there&rsquo;s an end of
      it. What&rsquo;s your business, play-actor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the repetition of this last word, to her so mysterious, the girl
      outside pressed her eyes more eagerly to the chink and strained her ears
      to listen more sedulously. And what did the count mean by the &ldquo;other one&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;a heavenly crown&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not call me king?&rdquo; asked Rudolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They call you that in Strelsau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those that know I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they are&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some few score.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thus,&rdquo; said Rupert, waving an arm towards the window, &ldquo;the town is
      quiet and the flags fly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been waiting to see them lowered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man likes to have some notice taken of what he has done,&rdquo; Rupert
      complained. &ldquo;However, I can get them lowered when I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By telling your news? Would that be good for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me&mdash;not that way. Since the king has two lives, it is but in
      nature that he should have two deaths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when he has undergone the second?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall live at peace, my friend, on a certain source of income that I
      possess.&rdquo; He tapped his breast-pocket with a slight, defiant laugh. &ldquo;In
      these days,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;even queens must be careful about their letters. We
      live in moral times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t share the responsibility for it,&rdquo; said Rudolf, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make my little protest. But what&rsquo;s your business, play-actor? For I
      think you&rsquo;re rather tiresome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf grew grave. He advanced towards the table, and spoke in low,
      serious tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, you&rsquo;re alone in this matter now. Rischenheim is a prisoner; your
      rogue Bauer I encountered last night and broke his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have what you know of in your hands. If you yield, on my honor I will
      save your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t desire my blood, then, most forgiving play-actor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much, that I daren&rsquo;t fail to offer you life,&rdquo; answered Rudolf
      Rassendyll. &ldquo;Come, sir, your plan has failed: give up the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupert looked at him thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see me safe off if I give it you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prevent your death. Yes, and I&rsquo;ll see you safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a fortress, where a trustworthy gentleman will guard you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how long, my dear friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope for many years, my dear Count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, I suppose, as long as&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven leaves you to the world, Count. It&rsquo;s impossible to set you free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the offer, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The extreme limit of indulgence,&rdquo; answered Rudolf. Rupert burst into a
      laugh, half of defiance, yet touched with the ring of true amusement. Then
      he lit a cigarette and sat puffing and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should wrong you by straining your kindness so far,&rdquo; said he; and in
      wanton insolence, seeking again to show Mr. Rassendyll the mean esteem in
      which he held him, and the weariness his presence was, he raised his arms
      and stretched them above his head, as a man does in the fatigue of tedium.
      &ldquo;Heigho!&rdquo; he yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had overshot the mark this time. With a sudden swift bound Rudolf
      was upon him; his hands gripped Rupert&rsquo;s wrists, and with his greater
      strength he bent back the count&rsquo;s pliant body till trunk and head lay flat
      on the table. Neither man spoke; their eyes met; each heard the other&rsquo;s
      breathing and felt the vapor of it on his face. The girl outside had seen
      the movement of Rudolf&rsquo;s figure, but her cranny did not serve her to show
      her the two where they were now; she knelt on her knees in ignorant
      suspense. Slowly and with a patient force Rudolf began to work his enemy&rsquo;s
      arms towards one another. Rupert had read his design in his eyes and
      resisted with tense muscles. It seemed as though his arms must crack; but
      at last they moved. Inch by inch they were driven closer; now the elbows
      almost touched; now the wrists joined in reluctant contact. The sweat
      broke out on the count&rsquo;s brow, and stood in large drops on Rudolf&rsquo;s. Now
      the wrists were side by side, and slowly the long sinewy fingers of
      Rudolf&rsquo;s right hand, that held one wrist already in their vise, began to
      creep round the other. The grip seemed to have half numbed Rupert&rsquo;s arms,
      and his struggles grew fainter. Round both wrists the sinewy fingers
      climbed and coiled; gradually and timidly the grasp of the other hand was
      relaxed and withdrawn. Would the one hold both? With a great spasm of
      effort Rupert put it to the proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile that bent Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s lips gave the answer. He could hold
      both, with one hand he could hold both: not for long, no, but for an
      instant. And then, in the instant, his left hand, free at last, shot to
      the breast of the count&rsquo;s coat. It was the same that he had worn at the
      hunting-lodge, and was ragged and torn from the boar-hound&rsquo;s teeth. Rudolf
      tore it further open, and his hand dashed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s curse on you!&rdquo; snarled Rupert of Hentzau.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Rassendyll still smiled. Then he drew out a letter. A glance at it
      showed him the queen&rsquo;s seal. As he glanced Rupert made another effort. The
      one hand, wearied out, gave way, and Mr. Rassendyll had no more than time
      to spring away, holding his prize. The next moment he had his revolver in
      his hand&mdash;none too soon, for Rupert of Hentzau&rsquo;s barrel faced him,
      and they stood thus, opposite to one another, with no more than three or
      four feet between the mouths of their weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, indeed, much that may be said against Rupert of Hentzau, the
      truth about him well-nigh forbidding that charity of judgment which we are
      taught to observe towards all men. But neither I nor any man who knew him
      ever found in him a shrinking from danger or a fear of death. It was no
      feeling such as these, but rather a cool calculation of chances, that now
      stayed his hand. Even if he were victorious in the duel, and both did not
      die, yet the noise of the firearms would greatly decrease his chances of
      escape. Moreover, he was a noted swordsman, and conceived that he was Mr.
      Rassendyll&rsquo;s superior in that exercise. The steel offered him at once a
      better prospect for victory and more hope of a safe fight. So he did not
      pull his trigger, but, maintaining his aim the while, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a street bully, and I don&rsquo;t excel in a rough-and-tumble. Will you
      fight now like a gentleman? There&rsquo;s a pair of blades in the case yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rassendyll, in his turn, was keenly alive to the peril that still hung
      over the queen. To kill Rupert would not save her if he himself also were
      shot and left dead, or so helpless that he could not destroy the letter;
      and while Rupert&rsquo;s revolver was at his heart he could not tear it up nor
      reach the fire that burnt on the other side of the room. Nor did he fear
      the result of a trial with steel, for he had kept himself in practice and
      improved his skill since the days when he came first to Strelsau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Provided we settle the matter here and now, the
      manner is the same to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put your revolver on the table, then, and I&rsquo;ll lay mine by the side of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; smiled Rudolf, &ldquo;but you must lay yours down first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to trust you, it seems, but you won&rsquo;t trust me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. You know you can trust me; you know that I can&rsquo;t trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flush swept over Rupert of Hentzau&rsquo;s face. There were moments
      when he saw, in the mirror of another&rsquo;s face or words, the estimation in
      which honorable men held him; and I believe that he hated Mr. Rassendyll
      most fiercely, not for thwarting his enterprise, but because he had more
      power than any other man to show him that picture. His brows knit in a
      frown, and his lips shut tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but though you won&rsquo;t fire, you&rsquo;ll destroy the letter,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;I
      know your fine distinctions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again I beg your pardon. You know very well that, although all Strelsau
      were at the door, I wouldn&rsquo;t touch the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an angry muttered oath Rupert flung his revolver on the table. Rudolf
      came forward and laid his by it. Then he took up both, and, crossing to
      the mantelpiece, laid them there; between there he placed the queen&rsquo;s
      letter. A bright blaze burnt in the grate; it needed but the slightest
      motion of his hand to set the letter beyond all danger. But he placed it
      carefully on the mantelpiece, and, with a slight smile on his face, turned
      to Rupert, saying: &ldquo;Now shall we resume the bout that Fritz von Tarlenheim
      interrupted in the forest of Zenda?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this while they had been speaking in subdued accents, resolution in
      one, anger in the other, keeping the voice in an even, deliberate lowness.
      The girl outside caught only a word here and there; but now suddenly the
      flash of steel gleamed on her eyes through the crevice of the hinge. She
      gave a sudden gasp, and, pressing her face closer to the opening, listened
      and looked. For Rupert of Hentzau had taken the swords from their case and
      put them on the table. With a slight bow Rudolf took one, and the two
      assumed their positions. Suddenly Rupert lowered his point. The frown
      vanished from his face, and he spoke in his usual bantering tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perhaps we&rsquo;re letting our feelings run away with
      us. Have you more of a mind now to be King of Ruritania? If so, I&rsquo;m ready
      to be the most faithful of your subjects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You honor me, Count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided, of course, that I&rsquo;m one of the most favored and the richest.
      Come, come, the fool is dead now; he lived like a fool and he died like a
      fool. The place is empty. A dead man has no rights and suffers no wrongs.
      Damn it, that&rsquo;s good law, isn&rsquo;t it? Take his place and his wife. You can
      pay my price then. Or are you still so virtuous? Faith, how little some
      men learn from the world they live in! If I had your chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Count, you&rsquo;d be the last man to trust Rupert of Hentzau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I made it worth his while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s a man who would take the pay and betray his associate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Rupert flushed. When he next spoke his voice was hard, cold, and
      low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, Rudolf Rassendyll,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you here and now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask no better than that you should try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I&rsquo;ll proclaim that woman for what she is in all Strelsau.&rdquo; A
      smile came on his lips as he watched Rudolf&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guard yourself, my lord,&rdquo; said Mr. Rassendyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, for no better than&mdash;There, man, I&rsquo;m ready for you.&rdquo; For Rudolf&rsquo;s
      blade had touched his in warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steel jangled. The girl&rsquo;s pale face was at the crevice of the hinge.
      She heard the blades cross again and again. Then one would run up the
      other with a sharp, grating slither. At times she caught a glimpse of a
      figure in quick forward lunge or rapid wary withdrawal. Her brain was
      almost paralyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignorant of the mind and heart of young Rupert, she could not conceive
      that he tried to kill the king. Yet the words she had caught sounded like
      the words of men quarreling, and she could not persuade herself that the
      gentlemen fenced only for pastime. They were not speaking now; but she
      heard their hard breathing and the movement of their unresting feet on the
      bare boards of the floor. Then a cry rang out, clear and merry with the
      fierce hope of triumph: &ldquo;Nearly! nearly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew the voice for Rupert of Hentzau&rsquo;s, and it was the king who
      answered calmly, &ldquo;Nearly isn&rsquo;t quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she listened. They seemed to have paused for a moment, for there was
      no sound, save of the hard breathing and deep-drawn pants of men who rest
      an instant in the midst of intense exertion. Then came again the clash and
      the slitherings; and one of them crossed into her view. She knew the tall
      figure and she saw the red hair: it was the king. Backward step by step he
      seemed to be driven, coming nearer and nearer to the door. At last there
      was no more than a foot between him and her; only the crazy panel
      prevented her putting out her hand to touch him. Again the voice of Rupert
      rang out in rich exultation, &ldquo;I have you now! Say your prayers, King
      Rudolf!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say your prayers!&rdquo; Then they fought. It was earnest, not play. And it was
      the king&mdash;her king&mdash;her dear king, who was in great peril of his
      life. For an instant she knelt, still watching. Then with a low cry of
      terror she turned and ran headlong down the steep stairs. Her mind could
      not tell what to do, but her heart cried out that she must do something
      for her king. Reaching the ground floor, she ran with wide-open eyes into
      the kitchen. The stew was on the hob, the old woman still held the spoon,
      but she had ceased to stir and fallen into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s killing the king! He&rsquo;s killing the king!&rdquo; cried Rosa, seizing her
      mother by the arm. &ldquo;Mother, what shall we do? He&rsquo;s killing the king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman looked up with dull eyes and a stupid, cunning smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them alone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no king here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. He&rsquo;s upstairs in the count&rsquo;s room. They&rsquo;re fighting, he and the
      Count of Hentzau. Mother, Count Rupert will kill&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them alone. He the king? He&rsquo;s no king,&rdquo; muttered the old woman again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Rosa stood looking down on her in helpless despair. Then a
      light flashed into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must call for help,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman seemed to spring to sudden life. She jumped up and caught
      her daughter by the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she whispered in quick accents. &ldquo;You&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know. Let
      them alone, you fool! It&rsquo;s not our business. Let them alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, mother, let me go! Mother, I must help the king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not let you go,&rdquo; said Mother Holf.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rosa was young and strong; her heart was fired with terror for the
      king&rsquo;s danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she cried; and she flung her mother&rsquo;s grasp off from her so
      that the old woman was thrown back into her chair, and the spoon fell from
      her hand and clattered on the tiles. But Rosa turned and fled down the
      passage and through the shop. The bolts delayed her trembling fingers for
      an instant. Then she flung the door wide. A new amazement filled her eyes
      at the sight of the eager crowd before the house. Then her eyes fell on me
      where I stood between the lieutenant and Rischenheim, and she uttered her
      wild cry, &ldquo;Help! The king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With one bound I was by her side and in the house, while Bernenstein
      cried, &ldquo;Quicker!&rdquo; from behind.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. THE TRIUMPH OF THE KING
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE things that men call presages, presentiments, and so forth, are, to my
      mind, for the most part idle nothings: sometimes it is only that probable
      events cast before them a natural shadow which superstitious fancy twists
      into a Heaven sent warning; oftener the same desire that gives conception
      works fulfilment, and the dreamer sees in the result of his own act and
      will a mysterious accomplishment independent of his effort. Yet when I
      observe thus calmly and with good sense on the matter to the Constable of
      Zenda, he shakes his head and answers, &ldquo;But Rudolf Rassendyll knew from
      the first that he would come again to Strelsau and engage young Rupert
      point to point. Else why did he practise with the foils so as to be a
      better swordsman the second time than he was the first? Mayn&rsquo;t God do
      anything that Fritz von Tarlenheim can&rsquo;t understand? a pretty notion, on
      my life!&rdquo; And he goes off grumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, be it inspiration, or be it delusion&mdash;and the difference stands
      often on a hair&rsquo;s breadth&mdash;I am glad that Rudolf had it. For if a man
      once grows rusty, it is everything short of impossible to put the fine
      polish on his skill again. Mr. Rassendyll had strength, will, coolness,
      and, of course, courage. None would have availed had not his eye been in
      perfect familiarity with its work, and his hand obeyed it as readily as
      the bolt slips in a well-oiled groove. As the thing stood, the lithe
      agility and unmatched dash of young Rupert but just missed being too much
      for him. He was in deadly peril when the girl Rosa ran down to bring him
      aid. His practised skill was able to maintain his defence. He sought to do
      no more, but endured Rupert&rsquo;s fiery attack and wily feints in an almost
      motionless stillness. Almost, I say; for the slight turns of wrist that
      seem nothing are everything, and served here to keep his skin whole and
      his life in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant&mdash;Rudolf saw it in his eyes and dwelt on it when
      he lightly painted the scene for me&mdash;when there dawned on Rupert of
      Hentzau the knowledge that he could not break down his enemy&rsquo;s guard.
      Surprise, chagrin, amusement, or something like it, seemed blended in his
      look. He could not make out how he was caught and checked in every effort,
      meeting, it seemed, a barrier of iron impregnable in rest. His quick brain
      grasped the lesson in an instant. If his skill were not the greater, the
      victory would not be his, for his endurance was the less. He was younger,
      and his frame was not so closely knit; pleasure had taken its tithe from
      him; perhaps a good cause goes for something. Even while he almost pressed
      Rudolf against the panel of the door, he seemed to know that his measure
      of success was full. But what the hand could not compass the head might
      contrive. In quickly conceived strategy he began to give pause in his
      attack, nay, he retreated a step or two. No scruples hampered his devices,
      no code of honor limited the means he would employ. Backing before his
      opponent, he seemed to Rudolf to be faint-hearted; he was baffled, but
      seemed despairing; he was weary, but played a more complete fatigue.
      Rudolf advanced, pressing and attacking, only to meet a defence as perfect
      as his own. They were in the middle of the room now, close by the table.
      Rupert, as though he had eyes in the back of his head, skirted round,
      avoiding it by a narrow inch. His breathing was quick and distressed, gasp
      tumbling over gasp, but still his eye was alert and his hand unerring. He
      had but a few moments&rsquo; more effort left in him: it was enough if he could
      reach his goal and perpetrate the trick on which his mind, fertile in
      every base device, was set. For it was towards the mantelpiece that his
      retreat, seeming forced, in truth so deliberate, led him. There was the
      letter, there lay the revolvers. The time to think of risks was gone by;
      the time to boggle over what honor allowed or forbade had never come to
      Rupert of Hentzau. If he could not win by force and skill, he would win by
      guile and by treachery, to the test that he had himself invited. The
      revolvers lay on the mantelpiece: he meant to possess himself of one, if
      he could gain an instant in which to snatch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The device that he adopted was nicely chosen. It was too late to call a
      rest or ask breathing space: Mr. Rassendyll was not blind to the advantage
      he had won, and chivalry would have turned to folly had it allowed such
      indulgence. Rupert was hard by the mantelpiece now. The sweat was pouring
      from his face, and his breast seemed like to burst in the effort after
      breath; yet he had enough strength for his purpose. He must have slackened
      his hold on his weapon, for when Rudolf&rsquo;s blade next struck it, it flew
      from his hand, twirled out of a nerveless grasp, and slid along the floor.
      Rupert stood disarmed, and Rudolf motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pick it up,&rdquo; said Mr. Rassendyll, never thinking there had been a trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and you&rsquo;ll truss me while I do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You young fool, don&rsquo;t you know me yet?&rdquo; and Rudolf, lowering his blade,
      rested its point on the floor, while with his left hand he indicated
      Rupert&rsquo;s weapon. Yet something warned him: it may be there came a look in
      Rupert&rsquo;s eyes, perhaps of scorn for his enemy&rsquo;s simplicity, perhaps of
      pure triumph in the graceless knavery. Rudolf stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You swear you won&rsquo;t touch me while I pick it up?&rdquo; asked Rupert, shrinking
      back a little, and thereby getting an inch or two nearer the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have my promise: pick it up. I won&rsquo;t wait any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t kill me unarmed?&rdquo; cried Rupert, in alarmed scandalized
      expostulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speech went unfinished, unless a sudden cry were its ending. And, as
      he cried, Rudolf Rassendyll, dropping his sword on the ground, sprang
      forward. For Rupert&rsquo;s hand had shot out behind him and was on the butt of
      one of the revolvers. The whole trick flashed on Rudolf, and he sprang,
      flinging his long arms round Rupert. But Rupert had the revolver in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all likelihood the two neither heard nor heeded, though it seemed to me
      that the creaks and groans of the old stairs were loud enough to wake the
      dead. For now Rosa had given the alarm, Bernenstein and I&mdash;or I and
      Bernenstein (for I was first, and, therefore, may put myself first)&mdash;had
      rushed up. Hard behind us came Rischenheim, and hot on his heels a score
      of fellows, pushing and shouldering and trampling. We in front had a fair
      start, and gained the stairs unimpeded; Rischenheim was caught up in the
      ruck and gulfed in the stormy, tossing group that struggled for first
      footing on the steps. Yet, soon they were after us, and we heard them
      reach the first landing as we sped up to the last. There was a confused
      din through all the house, and it seemed now to echo muffled and vague
      through the walls from the street without. I was conscious of it, although
      I paid no heed to anything but reaching the room where the king&mdash;where
      Rudolf&mdash;was. Now I was there, Bernenstein hanging to my heels. The
      door did not hold us a second. I was in, he after me. He slammed the door
      and set his back against it, just as the rush of feet flooded the highest
      flight of stairs. And at the moment a revolver shot rang clear and loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant and I stood still, he against the door, I a pace farther
      into the room. The sight we saw was enough to arrest us with its strange
      interest. The smoke of the shot was curling about, but neither man seemed
      wounded. The revolver was in Rupert&rsquo;s hand, and its muzzle smoked. But
      Rupert was jammed against the wall, just by the side of the mantelpiece.
      With one hand Rudolf had pinned his left arm to the wainscoting higher
      than his head, with the other he held his right wrist. I drew slowly
      nearer: if Rudolf were unarmed, I could fairly enforce a truce and put
      them on an equality; yet, though Rudolf was unarmed, I did nothing. The
      sight of his face stopped me. He was very pale and his lips were set, but
      it was his eyes that caught my gaze, for they were glad and merciless. I
      had never seen him look thus before. I turned from him to young Hentzau&rsquo;s
      face. Rupert&rsquo;s teeth were biting his under lip, the sweat dropped, and the
      veins swelled large and blue on his forehead; his eyes were set on Rudolf
      Rassendyll. Fascinated, I drew nearer. Then I saw what passed. Inch by
      inch Rupert&rsquo;s arm curved, the elbow bent, the hand that had pointed almost
      straight from him and at Mr. Rassendyll pointed now away from both towards
      the window. But its motion did not stop; it followed the line of a circle:
      now it was on Rupert&rsquo;s arm; still it moved, and quicker now, for the power
      of resistance grew less. Rupert was beaten; he felt it and knew it, and I
      read the knowledge in his eyes. I stepped up to Rudolf Rassendyll. He
      heard or felt me, and turned his eyes for an instant. I do not know what
      my face said, but he shook his head and turned back to Rupert. The
      revolver, held still in the man&rsquo;s own hand, was at his heart. The motion
      ceased, the point was reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked again at Rupert. Now his face was easier; there was a slight
      smile on his lips; he flung back his comely head and rested thus against
      the wainscoting; his eyes asked a question of Rudolf Rassendyll. I turned
      my gaze to where the answer was to come, for Rudolf made none in words. By
      the swiftest of movements he shifted his grasp from Rupert&rsquo;s wrist and
      pounced on his hand. Now his forefinger rested on Rupert&rsquo;s and Rupert&rsquo;s
      was on the trigger. I am no soft-heart, but I laid a hand on his shoulder.
      He took no heed; I dared do no more. Rupert glanced at me. I caught his
      look, but what could I say to him? Again my eyes were riveted on Rudolf&rsquo;s
      finger. Now it was crooked round Rupert&rsquo;s, seeming like a man who
      strangles another.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not say more. He smiled to the last; his proud head, which had
      never bent for shame, did not bend for fear. There was a sudden tightening
      in the pressure of that crooked forefinger, a flash, a noise. He was held
      up against the wall for an instant by Rudolf&rsquo;s hand; when that was removed
      he sank, a heap that looked all head and knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hot on the sound of the discharge came a shout and an oath from
      Bernenstein. He was hurled away from the door, and through it burst
      Rischenheim and the whole score after him. They were jostling one another
      and crying out to know what passed and where the king was. High over all
      the voices, coming from the back of the throng, I heard the cry of the
      girl Rosa. But as soon as they were in the room, the same spell that had
      fastened Bernenstein and me to inactivity imposed its numbing power on
      them also. Only Rischenheim gave a sudden sob and ran forward to where his
      cousin lay. The rest stood staring. For a moment Rudolf eyed them. Then,
      without a word, he turned his back. He put out the right hand with which
      he had just killed Rupert of Hentzau, and took the letter from the
      mantelpiece. He glanced at the envelope, then he opened the letter. The
      handwriting banished any last doubt he had; he tore the letter across, and
      again in four pieces, and yet again in smaller fragments. Then he
      sprinkled the morsels of paper into the blaze of the fire. I believe that
      every eye in the room followed them and watched till they curled and
      crinkled into black, wafery ashes. Thus, at last the queen&rsquo;s letter was
      safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had thus set the seal on his task he turned round to us again. He
      paid no heed to Rischenheim, who was crouching down by the body of Rupert;
      but he looked at Bernenstein and me, and then at the people behind us. He
      waited a moment before he spoke; then his utterance was not only calm but
      also very slow, so that he seemed to be choosing his words carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a full account of this matter will be rendered by
      myself in due time. For the present it must suffice to say that this
      gentleman who lies here dead sought an interview with me on private
      business. I came here to find him, desiring, as he professed, to desire,
      privacy. And here he tried to kill me. The result of his attempt you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed low, Bernenstein did the like, and all the rest followed our
      example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A full account shall be given,&rdquo; said Rudolf. &ldquo;Now let all leave me,
      except the Count of Tarlenheim and Lieutenant von Bernenstein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most unwillingly, with gaping mouths and wonder-struck eyes, the throng
      filed out of the door. Rischenheim rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stay, if you like,&rdquo; said Rudolf, and the count knelt again by his
      kinsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the rough bedsteads by the wall of the attic, I touched Rischenheim
      on the shoulder and pointed to one of them. Together we lifted Rupert of
      Hentzau. The revolver was still in his hand, but Bernenstein disengaged it
      from his grasp. Then Rischenheim and I laid him down, disposing his body
      decently and spreading over it his riding cloak, still spotted with the
      mud gathered on his midnight expedition to the hunting-lodge. His face
      looked much as before the shot was fired; in death, as in life, he was the
      handsomest fellow in all Ruritania. I wager that many tender hearts ached
      and many bright eyes were dimmed for him when the news of his guilt and
      death went forth. There are ladies still in Strelsau who wear his trinkets
      in an ashamed devotion that cannot forget. Well, even I, who had every
      good cause to hate and scorn him, set the hair smooth on his brow; while
      Rischenheim was sobbing like a child, and young Bernenstein rested his
      head on his arm as he leant on the mantelpiece, and would not look at the
      dead. Rudolf alone seemed not to heed him or think of him. His eyes had
      lost their unnatural look of joy, and were now calm and tranquil. He took
      his own revolver from the mantelpiece and put it in his pocket, laying
      Rupert&rsquo;s neatly where his had been. Then he turned to me and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us go to the queen and tell her that the letter is beyond reach
      of hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moved by some impulse, I walked to the window and put my head out. I was
      seen from below, and a great shout greeted me. The crowd before the doors
      grew every moment; the people flocking from all quarters would soon
      multiply it a hundred fold; for such news as had been carried from the
      attic by twenty wondering tongues spreads like a forest-fire. It would be
      through Strelsau in a few minutes, through the kingdom in an hour, through
      Europe in but little longer. Rupert was dead and the letter was safe, but
      what were we to tell that great concourse concerning their king? A queer
      feeling of helpless perplexity came over me and found vent in a foolish
      laugh. Bernenstein was by my side; he also looked out, and turned again
      with an eager face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a royal progress to your palace,&rdquo; said he to Rudolf
      Rassendyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rassendyll made no answer, but, coming to me, took my arm. We went
      out, leaving Rischenheim by the body. I did not think of him; Bernenstein
      probably thought that he would keep his pledge given to the queen, for he
      followed us immediately and without demur. There was nobody outside the
      door. The house was very quiet, and the tumult from the street reached us
      only in a muffled roar. But when we came to the foot of the stairs we
      found the two women. Mother Holf stood on the threshold of the kitchen,
      looking amazed and terrified. Rosa was clinging to her; but as soon as
      Rudolf came in sight, the girl sprang forward and flung herself on her
      knees before him, pouring out incoherent thanks to Heaven for his safety.
      He bent down and spoke to her in a whisper; she looked up with a flush of
      pride on her face. He seemed to hesitate a moment; he glanced at his
      hands, but he wore no ring save that which the queen had given him long
      ago. Then he disengaged his chain and took his gold watch from his pocket.
      Turning it over, he showed me the monogram, R. R.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rudolfus Rex,&rdquo; he whispered with a whimsical smile, and pressed the watch
      into the girl&rsquo;s hand, saying: &ldquo;Keep this to remind you of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and sobbed as she caught it with one hand, while with the
      other she held his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must let go,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I have much to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took her by the arm and induced her to rise. Rudolf, released, passed on
      to where the old woman stood. He spoke to her in a stern, distinct voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how far you are a party to the plot that was
      hatched in your house. For the present I am content not to know, for it is
      no pleasure to me to detect disloyalty or to punish an old woman. But take
      care! The first word you speak, the first act you do against me, the king,
      will bring its certain and swift punishment. If you trouble me, I won&rsquo;t
      spare you. In spite of traitors I am still king in Strelsau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, looking hard in her face. Her lip quivered and her eyes fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;I am king in Strelsau. Keep your hands out of
      mischief and your tongue quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer. He passed on. I was following, but as I went by her
      the old woman clutched my arm. &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, who is he?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; I asked, lifting my brows. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the king when he
      speaks to you? And you&rsquo;d best remember what he said. He has servants
      who&rsquo;ll do his orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She let me go and fell back a step. Young Bernenstein smiled at her; he at
      least found more pleasure than anxiety in our position. Thus, then, we
      left them: the old woman terrified, amazed, doubtful; the girl with ruddy
      cheeks and shining eyes, clasping in her two hands the keepsake that the
      king himself had given her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernenstein had more presence of mind than I. He ran forward, got in front
      of both of us, and flung the door open. Then, bowing very low, he stood
      aside to let Rudolf pass. The street was full from end to end now, and a
      mighty shout of welcome rose from thousands of throats. Hats and
      handkerchiefs were waved in mad exultation and triumphant loyalty. The
      tidings of the king&rsquo;s escape had flashed through the city, and all were
      there to do him honor. They had seized some gentleman&rsquo;s landau and taken
      out the horses. The carriage stood now before the doors of the house.
      Rudolf had waited a moment on the threshold, lifting his hat once or
      twice; his face was perfectly calm, and I saw no trembling in his hands.
      In an instant a dozen arms took gentle hold of him and impelled him
      forward. He mounted into the carriage; Bernenstein and I followed, with
      bare heads, and sat on the back seat, facing him. The people were round as
      thick as bees, and it seemed as though we could not move without crushing
      somebody. Yet presently the wheels turned, and they began to drag us away
      at a slow walk. Rudolf kept raising his hat, bowing now to right, now to
      left. But once, as he turned, his eyes met ours. In spite of what was
      behind and what was in front, we all three smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish they&rsquo;d go a little quicker,&rdquo; said Rudolf in a whisper, as he
      conquered his smile and turned again to acknowledge the loyal greetings of
      his subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what did they know of any need for haste? They did not know what stood
      on the turn of the next few hours, nor the momentous question that pressed
      for instant decision. So far from hurrying, they lengthened our ride by
      many pauses; they kept us before the cathedral, while some ran and got the
      joy bells set ringing; we were stopped to receive improvised bouquets from
      the hands of pretty girls and impetuous hand-shakings from enthusiastic
      loyalists. Through it all Rudolf kept his composure, and seemed to play
      his part with native kingliness. I heard Bernenstein whisper, &ldquo;By God, we
      must stick to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last we came in sight of the palace. Here also there was a great stir.
      Many officers and soldiers were about. I saw the chancellor&rsquo;s carriage
      standing near the portico, and a dozen other handsome equipages were
      waiting till they could approach. Our human horses drew us slowly up to
      the entrance. Helsing was on the steps, and ran down to the carriage,
      greeting the king with passionate fervor. The shouts of the crowd grew
      louder still.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly a stillness fell on them; it lasted but an instant, and was
      the prelude to a deafening roar. I was looking at Rudolf and saw his head
      turn suddenly and his eyes grow bright. I looked where his eyes had gone.
      There, on the top step of the broad marble flight, stood the queen, pale
      as the marble itself, stretching out her hands towards Rudolf. The people
      had seen her: she it was whom this last rapturous cheer greeted. My wife
      stood close behind her, and farther back others of her ladies. Bernenstein
      and I sprang out. With a last salute to the people Rudolf followed us. He
      walked up to the highest step but one, and there fell on one knee and
      kissed the queen&rsquo;s hand. I was by him, and when he looked up in her face I
      heard him say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well. He&rsquo;s dead, and the letter burnt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised him with her hand. Her lips moved, but it seemed as though she
      could find no words to speak. She put her arm through his, and thus they
      stood for an instant, fronting all Strelsau. Again the cheers rang out,
      and young Bernenstein sprang forward, waving his helmet and crying like a
      man possessed, &ldquo;God save the king!&rdquo; I was carried away by his enthusiasm
      and followed his lead. All the people took up the cry with boundless
      fervor, and thus we all, high and low in Strelsau, that afternoon hailed
      Mr. Rassendyll for our king. There had been no such zeal since Henry the
      Lion came back from his wars, a hundred and fifty years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; observed old Helsing at my elbow, &ldquo;agitators say that there is
      no enthusiasm for the house of Elphberg!&rdquo; He took a pinch of snuff in
      scornful satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Bernenstein interrupted his cheering with a short laugh, but fell to
      his task again in a moment. I had recovered my senses by now, and stood
      panting, looking down on the crowd. It was growing dusk and the faces
      became blurred into a white sea. Yet suddenly I seemed to discern one
      glaring up at me from the middle of the crowd&mdash;the pale face of a man
      with a bandage about his head. I caught Bernenstein&rsquo;s arm and whispered,
      &ldquo;Bauer,&rdquo; pointing with my finger where the face was. But, even as I
      pointed, it was gone; though it seemed impossible for a man to move in
      that press, yet it was gone. It had come like a cynic&rsquo;s warning across the
      scene of mock triumph, and went swiftly as it had come, leaving behind it
      a reminder of our peril. I felt suddenly sick at heart, and almost cried
      out to the people to have done with their silly shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last we got away. The plea of fatigue met all visitors who made their
      way to the door and sought to offer their congratulations; it could not
      disperse the crowd that hung persistently and contentedly about, ringing
      us in the palace with a living fence. We still heard their jests and
      cheers when we were alone in the small saloon that opens on the gardens.
      My wife and I had come here at Rudolf&rsquo;s request; Bernenstein had assumed
      the duty of guarding the door. Evening was now falling fast, and it grew
      dark. The garden was quiet; the distant noise of the crowd threw its
      stillness into greater relief. Rudolf told us there the story of his
      struggle with Rupert of Hentzau in the attic of the old house, dwelling on
      it as lightly as he could. The queen stood by his chair&mdash;she would
      not let him rise; when he finished by telling how he had burnt her letter,
      she stooped suddenly and kissed him off the brow. Then she looked straight
      across at Helga, almost defiantly; but Helga ran to her and caught her in
      her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf Rassendyll sat with his head resting on his hand. He looked up once
      at the two women; then he caught my eye, and beckoned me to come to him. I
      approached him, but for several moments he did not speak. Again he
      motioned to me, and, resting my hand on the arm of his chair, I bent my
      head close down to his. He glanced again at the queen, seeming afraid that
      she would hear what he wished to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fritz,&rdquo; he whispered at last, &ldquo;as soon as it&rsquo;s fairly dark I must get
      away. Bernenstein will come with me. You must stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the lodge. I must meet Sapt and arrange matters with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not understand what plan he had in his head, or what scheme he could
      contrive. But at the moment my mind was not directed to such matters; it
      was set on the sight before my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the queen?&rdquo; I whispered in answer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low as my voice was, she heard it. She turned to us with a sudden,
      startled movement, still holding Helga&rsquo;s hand. Her eyes searched our
      faces, and she knew in an instant of what we had been speaking. A little
      longer still she stood, gazing at us. Then she suddenly sprang forward and
      threw herself on her knees before Rudolf, her hands uplifted and resting
      on his shoulders. She forgot our presence, and everything in the world,
      save her great dread of losing him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not again, Rudolf, my darling! Not again! Rudolf, I can&rsquo;t bear it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she dropped her head on his knees and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hand and gently stroked the gleaming hair. But he did not
      look at her. He gazed out at the garden, which grew dark and dreary in the
      gathering gloom. His lips were tight set and his face pale and drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched him for a moment, then I drew my wife away, and we sat down at a
      table some way off. From outside still came the cheers and tumult of the
      joyful, excited crowd. Within there was no sound but the queen&rsquo;s stifled
      sobbing. Rudolf caressed her shining hair and gazed into the night with
      sad, set eyes. She raised her head and looked into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll break my heart,&rdquo; she said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. FOR OUR LOVE AND HER HONOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      RUPERT of Hentzau was dead! That was the thought which, among all our
      perplexities, came back to me, carrying with it a wonderful relief. To
      those who have not learnt in fighting against him the height of his
      audacity and the reach of his designs, it may well seem incredible that
      his death should breed comfort at a moment when the future was still so
      dark and uncertain. Yet to me it was so great a thing that I could hardly
      bring myself to the conviction that we had done with him. True, he was
      dead; but could he not strike a blow at us even from beyond the gulf?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the half-superstitious thoughts that forced their way into my
      mind as I stood looking out on the crowd which obstinately encircled the
      front of the palace. I was alone; Rudolf was with the queen, my wife was
      resting, Bernenstein had sat down to a meal for which I could find no
      appetite. By an effort I freed myself from my fancies and tried to
      concentrate my brain on the facts of our position. We were ringed round
      with difficulties. To solve them was beyond my power; but I knew where my
      wish and longing lay. I had no desire to find means by which Rudolf
      Rassendyll should escape unknown from Strelsau; the king, although dead,
      be again in death the king, and the queen be left desolate on her mournful
      and solitary throne. It might be that a brain more astute than mine could
      bring all this to pass. My imagination would have none of it, but dwelt
      lovingly on the reign of him who was now king in Strelsau, declaring that
      to give the kingdom such a ruler would be a splendid fraud, and prove a
      stroke so bold as to defy detection. Against it stood only the suspicions
      of Mother Holf&mdash;fear or money would close her lips&mdash;and the
      knowledge of Bauer; Bauer&rsquo;s mouth also could be shut, ay, and should be
      before we were many days older. My reverie led me far; I saw the future
      years unroll before me in the fair record of a great king&rsquo;s sovereignty.
      It seemed to me that by the violence and bloodshed we had passed through,
      fate, for once penitent, was but righting the mistake made when Rudolf was
      not born a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long while I stood thus, musing and dreaming; I was roused by the
      sound of the door opening and closing; turning, I saw the queen. She was
      alone, and came towards me with timid steps. She looked out for a moment
      on the square and the people, but drew back suddenly in apparent fear lest
      they should see her. Then she sat down and turned her face towards mine. I
      read in her eyes something of the conflict of emotions which possessed
      her; she seemed at once to deprecate my disapproval and to ask my
      sympathy; she prayed me to be gentle to her fault and kind to her
      happiness; self-reproach shadowed her joy, but the golden gleam of it
      strayed through. I looked eagerly at her; this would not have been her
      bearing had she come from a last farewell; for the radiance was there,
      however much dimmed by sorrow and by fearfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fritz,&rdquo; she began softly, &ldquo;I am wicked&mdash;so wicked. Won&rsquo;t God punish
      me for my gladness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fear I paid little heed to her trouble, though I can understand it well
      enough now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gladness?&rdquo; I cried in a low voice. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve persuaded him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at me for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, you&rsquo;ve agreed?&rdquo; I stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes again sought mine, and she said in a whisper: &ldquo;Some day, not now.
      Oh, not now. Now would be too much. But some day, Fritz, if God will not
      deal too hardly with me, I&mdash;I shall be his, Fritz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was intent on my vision, not on hers. I wanted him king; she did not
      care what he was, so that he was hers, so that he should not leave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll take the throne,&rdquo; I cried triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no. Not the throne. He&rsquo;s going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going away!&rdquo; I could not keep the dismay out of my voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, now. But not&mdash;not for ever. It will be long&mdash;oh, so long&mdash;but
      I can bear it, if I know that at last!&rdquo; She stopped, still looking up at
      me with eyes that implored pardon and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said I, bluntly, and, I fear, gruffly, also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;I did persuade him. He wanted to go away
      again as he went before. Ought I to have let him? Yes, yes! But I
      couldn&rsquo;t. Fritz, hadn&rsquo;t I done enough? You don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve endured.
      And I must endure more still. For he will go now, and the time will be
      very long. But, at last, we shall be together. There is pity in God; we
      shall be together at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he goes now, how can he come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not come back; I shall go to him. I shall give up the throne and
      go to him, some day, when I can be spared from here, when I&rsquo;ve done my&mdash;my
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was aghast at this shattering of my vision, yet I could not be hard to
      her. I said nothing, but took her hand and pressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted him to be king?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart, madam,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t, Fritz. No, and I shouldn&rsquo;t dare to do that, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fell back on the practical difficulties. &ldquo;But how can he go?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But he knows; he has a plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We fell again into silence; her eyes grew more calm, and seemed to look
      forward in patient hope to the time when her happiness should come to her.
      I felt like a man suddenly robbed of the exaltation of wine and sunk to
      dull apathy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how he can go,&rdquo; I said sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer me. A moment later the door again opened. Rudolf came
      in, followed by Bernenstein. Both wore riding boots and cloaks. I saw on
      Bernenstein&rsquo;s face just such a look of disappointment as I knew must be on
      mine. Rudolf seemed calm and even happy. He walked straight up to the
      queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horses will be ready in a few minutes,&rdquo; he said gently. Then, turning
      to me, he asked, &ldquo;You know what we&rsquo;re going to do, Fritz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, sire,&rdquo; I answered, sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, sire!&rdquo; he repeated, in a half-merry, half-sad mockery. Then he
      came between Bernenstein and me and passed his arms through ours. &ldquo;You two
      villains!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You two unscrupulous villains! Here you are, as rough
      as bears, because I won&rsquo;t be a thief! Why have I killed young Rupert and
      left you rogues alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt the friendly pressure of his hand on my arm. I could not answer
      him. With every word from his lips and every moment of his presence my
      sorrow grew keener that he would not stay. Bernenstein looked across at me
      and shrugged his shoulders despairingly. Rudolf gave a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forgive me for not being as great a rogue, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I found nothing to say, but I took my arm out of his and clasped his
      hand. He gripped mine hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s old Fritz!&rdquo; he said; and he caught hold of Bernenstein&rsquo;s hand,
      which the lieutenant yielded with some reluctance. &ldquo;Now for the plan,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Bernenstein and I set out at once for the lodge&mdash;yes,
      publicly, as publicly as we can. I shall ride right through the people
      there, showing myself to as many as will look at me, and letting it be
      known to everybody where I&rsquo;m going. We shall get there quite early
      to-morrow, before it&rsquo;s light. There we shall find what you know. We shall
      find Sapt, too, and he&rsquo;ll put the finishing touches to our plan for us.
      Hullo, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden fresh shouting from the large crowd that still lingered
      outside the palace. I ran to the window, and saw a commotion in the midst
      of them. I flung the sash up. Then I heard a well-known, loud, strident
      voice: &ldquo;Make way, you rascals, make way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned round again, full of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sapt himself!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s riding like mad through the crowd, and
      your servant&rsquo;s just behind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, what&rsquo;s happened? Why have they left the lodge?&rdquo; cried
      Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen looked up in startled alarm, and, rising to her feet, came and
      passed her arm through Rudolf&rsquo;s. Thus we all stood, listening to the
      people good-naturedly cheering Sapt, whom they had recognized, and
      bantering James, whom they took for a servant of the constable&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes seemed very long as we waited in utter perplexity, almost in
      consternation. The same thought was in the mind of all of us, silently
      imparted by one to another in the glances we exchanged. What could have
      brought them from their guard of the great secret, save its discovery?
      They would never have left their post while the fulfilment of their trust
      was possible. By some mishap, some unforeseen chance, the king&rsquo;s body must
      have been discovered. Then the king&rsquo;s death was known, and the news of it
      might any moment astonish and bewilder the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the door was flung open, and a servant announced the Constable of
      Zenda. Sapt was covered with dust and mud, and James, who entered close on
      his heels, was in no better plight. Evidently they had ridden hard and
      furiously; indeed they were still panting. Sapt, with a most perfunctory
      bow to the queen, came straight to where Rudolf stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; he asked, without preface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Rupert is dead,&rdquo; answered Mr. Rassendyll: &ldquo;I killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I burnt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Rischenheim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen struck in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count of Luzau-Rischenheim will say and do nothing against me,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt lifted his brows a little. &ldquo;Well, and Bauer?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bauer&rsquo;s at large,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Well, it&rsquo;s only Bauer,&rdquo; said the constable, seeming tolerably well
      pleased. Then his eyes fell on Rudolf and Bernenstein. He stretched out
      his hand and pointed to their riding-boots. &ldquo;Whither away so late at
      night?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First together to the lodge, to find you, then I alone to the frontier,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Rassendyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing at a time. The frontier will wait. What does your Majesty want
      with me at the lodge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want so to contrive that I shall be no longer your Majesty,&rdquo; said
      Rudolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt flung himself into a chair and took off his gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, tell me what has happened to-day in Strelsau,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      We gave a short and hurried account. He listened with few signs of
      approval or disapproval, but I thought I saw a gleam in his eyes when I
      described how all the city had hailed Rudolf as its king and the queen
      received him as her husband before the eyes of all. Again the hope and
      vision, shattered by Rudolf&rsquo;s calm resolution, inspired me. Sapt said
      little, but he had the air of a man with some news in reserve. He seemed
      to be comparing what we told him with something already known to him but
      unknown to us. The little servant stood all the while in respectful
      stillness by the door; but I could see by a glance at his alert face that
      he followed the whole scene with keen attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the story, Rudolf turned to Sapt. &ldquo;And your secret&mdash;is
      it safe?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s safe enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody has seen what you had to hide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and nobody knows that the king is dead,&rdquo; answered Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what brings you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the same thing that was about to bring you to the lodge: the need of
      a meeting between yourself and me, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lodge&mdash;is it left unguarded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lodge is safe enough,&rdquo; said Colonel Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unquestionably there was a secret, a new secret, hidden behind the curt
      words and brusque manner. I could restrain myself no longer, and sprang
      forward, saying: &ldquo;What is it? Tell us, Constable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me, then glanced at Mr. Rassendyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to hear your plan first,&rdquo; he said to Rudolf. &ldquo;How do you
      mean to account for your presence alive in the city to-day, when the king
      has lain dead in the shooting-box since last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We drew close together as Rudolf began his answer. Sapt alone lay back in
      his chair. The queen also had resumed her seat; she seemed to pay little
      heed to what we said. I think that she was still engrossed with the
      struggle and tumult in her own soul. The sin of which she accused herself,
      and the joy to which her whole being sprang in a greeting which would not
      be abashed, were at strife between themselves, but joined hands to exclude
      from her mind any other thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour I must be gone from here,&rdquo; began Rudolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish that, it&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; observed Colonel Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Sapt, be reasonable,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Rassendyll. &ldquo;Early to-morrow, we&mdash;you
      and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I also?&rdquo; asked the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you, Bernenstein, and I will be at the lodge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not impossible, though I have had nearly enough riding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf fixed his eyes firmly on Sapt&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the king reaches his hunting-lodge early in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I follow you, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what happens there, Sapt? Does he shoot himself accidentally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that happens sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or does an assassin kill him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, but you&rsquo;ve made the best assassin unavailable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even at this moment I could not help smiling at the old fellow&rsquo;s surly wit
      and Rudolf&rsquo;s amused tolerance of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or does his faithful attendant, Herbert, shoot him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, make poor Herbert a murderer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! By accident&mdash;and then, in remorse, kill himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very pretty. But doctors have awkward views as to when a man can
      have shot himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good Constable, doctors have palms as well as ideas. If you fill the
      one you supply the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Sapt, &ldquo;that both the plans are good. Suppose we choose the
      latter, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, by to-morrow at midday the news flashes through Ruritania&mdash;yes,
      and through Europe&mdash;that the king, miraculously preserved to-day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praise be to God!&rdquo; interjected Colonel Sapt; and young Bernenstein
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has met a tragic end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will occasion great grief,&rdquo; said Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, I am safe over the frontier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are quite safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely. And in the afternoon of to-morrow, you and Bernenstein will
      set out for Strelsau, bringing with you the body of the king.&rdquo; And Rudolf,
      after a pause, whispered, &ldquo;You must shave his face. And if the doctors
      want to talk about how long he&rsquo;s been dead, why, they have, as I say,
      palms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt sat silent for a while, apparently considering the scheme. It was
      risky enough in all conscience, but success had made Rudolf bold, and he
      had learnt how slow suspicion is if a deception be bold enough. It is only
      likely frauds that are detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you say?&rdquo; asked Mr. Rassendyll. I observed that he said
      nothing to Sapt of what the queen and he had determined to do afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt wrinkled his forehead. I saw him glance at James, and the slightest,
      briefest smile showed on James&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous, of course,&rdquo; pursued Rudolf. &ldquo;But I believe that when they
      see the king&rsquo;s body&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point,&rdquo; interrupted Sapt. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t see the king&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf looked at him with some surprise. Then speaking in a low voice,
      lest the queen should hear and be distressed, he went on: &ldquo;You must
      prepare it, you know. Bring it here in a shell; only a few officials need
      see the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt rose to his feet and stood facing Mr. Rassendyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The plan&rsquo;s a pretty one, but it breaks down at one point,&rdquo; said he in a
      strange voice, even harsher than his was wont to be. I was on fire with
      excitement, for I would have staked my life now that he had some strange
      tidings for us. &ldquo;There is no body,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s composure gave way. He sprang forward, catching Sapt
      by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No body? What do you mean?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt cast another glance at James, and then began in an even, mechanical
      voice, as though he were reading a lesson he had learnt, or playing a part
      that habit made familiar:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That poor fellow Herbert carelessly left a candle burning where the oil
      and the wood were kept,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This afternoon, about six, James and I
      lay down for a nap after our meal. At about seven James came to my side
      and roused me. My room was full of smoke. The lodge was ablaze. I darted
      out of bed: the fire had made too much headway; we could not hope to
      quench it; we had but one thought!&rdquo; He suddenly paused, and looked at
      James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one thought, to save our companion,&rdquo; said James gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one thought, to save our companion. We rushed to the door of the room
      where he was. I opened the door and tried to enter. It was certain death.
      James tried, but fell back. Again I rushed in. James pulled me back: it
      was but another death. We had to save ourselves. We gained the open air.
      The lodge was a sheet of flame. We could do nothing but stand watching,
      till the swiftly burning wood blackened to ashes and the flames died down.
      As we watched we knew that all in the cottage must be dead. What could we
      do? At last James started off in the hope of getting help. He found a
      party of charcoal-burners, and they came with him. The flames were burnt
      down now; and we and they approached the charred ruins. Everything was in
      ashes. But&rdquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice&mdash;&ldquo;we found what seemed to be
      the body of Boris the hound; in another room was a charred corpse, whose
      hunting-horn, melted to a molten mass, told us that it had been Herbert
      the forester. And there was another corpse, almost shapeless, utterly
      unrecognizable. We saw it; the charcoal-burners saw it. Then more peasants
      came round, drawn by the sight of the flames. None could tell who it was;
      only I and James knew. And we mounted our horses and have ridden here to
      tell the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt finished his lesson or his story. A sob burst from the queen, and she
      hid her face in her hands. Bernenstein and I, amazed at this strange tale,
      scarcely understanding whether it were jest or earnest, stood staring
      stupidly at Sapt. Then I, overcome by the strange thing, turned
      half-foolish by the bizarre mingling of comedy and impressiveness in
      Sapt&rsquo;s rendering of it, plucked him by the sleeve, and asked, with
      something between a laugh and a gasp:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who had that other corpse been, Constable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his small, keen eyes on me in persistent gravity and unflinching
      effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Mr. Rassendyll, a friend of the king&rsquo;s, who with his servant James was
      awaiting his Majesty&rsquo;s return from Strelsau. His servant here is ready to
      start for England, to tell Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s relatives the news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen had begun to listen before now; her eyes were fixed on Sapt, and
      she had stretched out one arm to him, as if imploring him to read her his
      riddle. But a few words had in truth declared his device plainly enough in
      all its simplicity. Rudolf Rassendyll was dead, his body burnt to a
      cinder, and the king was alive, whole, and on his throne in Strelsau. Thus
      had Sapt caught from James, the servant, the infection of his madness, and
      had fulfilled in action the strange imagination which the little man had
      unfolded to him in order to pass their idle hours at the lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mr. Rassendyll spoke in clear, short tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all a lie, Sapt,&rdquo; said he, and his lips curled in contemptuous
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no lie that the lodge is burnt, and the bodies in it, and that half
      a hundred of the peasants know it, and that no man could tell the body for
      the king&rsquo;s. As for the rest, it is a lie. But I think the truth in it is
      enough to serve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men stood facing one another with defiant eyes. Rudolf had caught
      the meaning of the great and audacious trick which Sapt and his companion
      had played. It was impossible now to bring the king&rsquo;s body to Strelsau; it
      seemed no less impossible to declare that the man burnt in the lodge was
      the king. Thus Sapt had forced Rudolf&rsquo;s hand; he had been inspired by the
      same vision as we, and endowed with more unshrinking boldness. But when I
      saw how Rudolf looked at him, I did not know but that they would go from
      the queen&rsquo;s presence set on a deadly quarrel. Mr. Rassendyll, however,
      mastered his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all bent on having me a rascal,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;Fritz and
      Bernenstein here urge me; you, Sapt, try to force me. James, there, is in
      the plot, for all I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggested it, sir,&rdquo; said James, not defiantly or with disrespect, but
      as if in simple dutiful obedience to his master&rsquo;s implied question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I thought&mdash;all of you! Well, I won&rsquo;t be forced. I see now that
      there&rsquo;s no way out of this affair, save one. That one I&rsquo;ll follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We none of us spoke, but waited till he should be pleased to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the queen&rsquo;s letter I need say nothing and will say nothing,&rdquo; he
      pursued. &ldquo;But I will tell them that I&rsquo;m not the king, but Rudolf
      Rassendyll, and that I played the king only in order to serve the queen
      and punish Rupert of Hentzau. That will serve, and it will cut this net of
      Sapt&rsquo;s from about my limbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke firmly and coldly; so that when I looked at him I was amazed to
      see how his lips twitched and that his forehead was moist with sweat. Then
      I understood what a sudden, swift, and fearful struggle he had suffered,
      and how the great temptation had wrung and tortured him before he,
      victorious, had set the thing behind him. I went to him and clasped his
      hand: this action of mine seemed to soften him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sapt, Sapt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you almost made a rogue of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sapt did not respond to his gentler mood. He had been pacing angrily up
      and down the room. Now he stopped abruptly before Rudolf, and pointed with
      his finger at the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make a rogue of you?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And what do you make of our queen,
      whom we all serve? What does this truth that you&rsquo;ll tell make of her?
      Haven&rsquo;t I heard how she greeted you before all Strelsau as her husband and
      her love? Will they believe that she didn&rsquo;t know her husband? Ay, you may
      show yourself, you may say they didn&rsquo;t know you. Will they believe she
      didn&rsquo;t? Was the king&rsquo;s ring on your finger? Where is it? And how comes Mr.
      Rassendyll to be at Fritz von Tarlenheim&rsquo;s for hours with the queen, when
      the king is at his hunting lodge? A king has died already, and two men
      besides, to save a word against her. And you&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be the man to
      set every tongue in Strelsau talking, and every finger pointing in
      suspicion at her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf made no answer. When Sapt had first uttered the queen&rsquo;s name, he
      had drawn near and let his hand fall over the back of her chair. She put
      hers up to meet it, and so they remained. But I saw that Rudolf&rsquo;s face had
      gone very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we, your friends?&rdquo; pursued Sapt. &ldquo;For we&rsquo;ve stood by you as we&rsquo;ve
      stood by the queen, by God we have&mdash;Fritz, and young Bernenstein
      here, and I. If this truth&rsquo;s told, who&rsquo;ll believe that we were loyal to
      the king, that we didn&rsquo;t know, that we weren&rsquo;t accomplices in the tricking
      of the king&mdash;maybe, in his murder? Ah, Rudolf Rassendyll, God
      preserve me from a conscience that won&rsquo;t let me be true to the woman I
      love, or to the friends who love me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen the old fellow so moved; he carried me with him, as he
      carried Bernenstein. I know now that we were too ready to be convinced;
      rather that, borne along by our passionate desire, we needed no convincing
      at all. His excited appeal seemed to us an argument. At least the danger
      to the queen, on which he dwelt, was real and true and great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a sudden change came over him. He caught Rudolf&rsquo;s hand and spoke to
      him again in a low, broken voice, an unwonted softness transforming his
      harsh tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say no. Here&rsquo;s the finest lady alive sick for her
      lover, and the finest country in the world sick for its true king, and the
      best friends&mdash;ay, by Heaven, the best friends&mdash;man ever had,
      sick to call you master. I know nothing about your conscience; but this I
      know: the king&rsquo;s dead, and the place is empty; and I don&rsquo;t see what
      Almighty God sent you here for unless it was to fill it. Come, lad&mdash;for
      our love and her honor! While he was alive I&rsquo;d have killed you sooner than
      let you take it. He&rsquo;s dead. Now&mdash;for our love and her honor, lad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not know what thoughts passed in Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s mind. His face was
      set and rigid. He made no sign when Sapt finished, but stood as he was,
      motionless, for a long while. Then he slowly bent his head and looked down
      into the queen&rsquo;s eyes. For a while she sat looking back into his. Then,
      carried away by the wild hope of immediate joy, and by her love for him
      and her pride in the place he was offered, she sprang up and threw herself
      at his feet, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! For my sake, Rudolf&mdash;for my sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you, too, against me, my queen?&rdquo; he murmured caressing her ruddy
      hair.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE DECISION OF HEAVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE were half mad that night, Sapt and Bernenstein and I. The thing seemed
      to have got into our blood and to have become part of ourselves. For us it
      was inevitable&mdash;nay, it was done. Sapt busied himself in preparing
      the account of the fire at the hunting-lodge; it was to be communicated to
      the journals, and it told with much circumstantiality how Rudolf
      Rassendyll had come to visit the king, with James his servant, and, the
      king being summoned unexpectedly to the capital, had been awaiting his
      Majesty&rsquo;s return when he met his fate. There was a short history of
      Rudolf, a glancing reference to his family, a dignified expression of
      condolence with his relatives, to whom the king was sending messages of
      deepest regret by the hands of Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s servant. At another table
      young Bernenstein was drawing up, under the constable&rsquo;s direction, a
      narrative of Rupert of Hentzau&rsquo;s attempt on the king&rsquo;s life and the king&rsquo;s
      courage in defending himself. The count, eager to return (so it ran), had
      persuaded the king to meet him by declaring that he held a state-document
      of great importance and of a most secret nature; the king, with his
      habitual fearlessness, had gone alone, but only to refuse with scorn Count
      Rupert&rsquo;s terms. Enraged at this unfavorable reception, the audacious
      criminal had made a sudden attack on the king, with what issue all knew.
      He had met his own death, while the king, perceiving from a glance at the
      document that it compromised well-known persons, had, with the nobility
      which marked him, destroyed it unread before the eyes of those who were
      rushing in to his rescue. I supplied suggestions and improvements; and,
      engrossed in contriving how to blind curious eyes, we forgot the real and
      permanent difficulties of the thing we had resolved upon. For us they did
      not exist; Sapt met every objection by declaring that the thing had been
      done once and could be done again. Bernenstein and I were not behind him
      in confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would guard the secret with brain and hand and life, even as we had
      guarded and kept the secret of the queen&rsquo;s letter, which would now go with
      Rupert of Hentzau to his grave. Bauer we could catch and silence: nay, who
      would listen to such a tale from such a man? Rischenheim was ours; the old
      woman would keep her doubts between her teeth for her own sake. To his own
      land and his own people Rudolf must be dead while the King of Ruritania
      would stand before all Europe recognized, unquestioned, unassailed. True,
      he must marry the queen again; Sapt was ready with the means, and would
      hear nothing of the difficulty and risk in finding a hand to perform the
      necessary ceremony. If we quailed in our courage: we had but to look at
      the alternative, and find recompense for the perils of what we meant to
      undertake by a consideration of the desperate risk involved in abandoning it.
      Persuaded that the substitution of Rudolf for the king was the only thing that would
      serve our turn, we asked no longer whether it was possible, but sought only
      the means to make it safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rudolf himself had not spoken. Sapt&rsquo;s appeal and the queen&rsquo;s imploring
      cry had shaken but not overcome him; he had wavered, but he was not won.
      Yet there was no talk of impossibility or peril in his mouth, any more
      than in ours: those were not what gave him pause. The score on which he
      hesitated was whether the thing should be done, not whether it could; our
      appeals were not to brace a failing courage, but cajole a sturdy sense of
      honor which found the imposture distasteful so soon as it seemed to serve
      a personal end. To serve the king he had played the king in old days, but
      he did not love to play the king when the profit of it was to be his own.
      Hence he was unmoved till his care for the fair fame of the queen and the
      love of his friends joined to buffet his resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he faltered; but he had not fallen. Yet Colonel Sapt did all as
      though he had given his assent, and watched the last hours in which his
      flight from Strelsau was possible go quickly by with more than equanimity.
      Why hurry Rudolf&rsquo;s resolve? Every moment shut him closer in the trap of an
      inevitable choice. With every hour that he was called the king, it became
      more impossible for him to bear any other name all his days. Therefore
      Sapt let Mr. Rassendyll doubt and struggle, while he himself wrote his
      story and laid his long-headed plans. And now and then James, the little
      servant, came in and went out, sedate and smug, but with a quiet
      satisfaction gleaming in his eyes. He had made a story for a pastime, and
      it was being translated into history. He at least would bear his part in
      it unflinchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before now the queen had left us, persuaded to lie down and try to rest
      till the matter should be settled. Stilled by Rudolf&rsquo;s gentle rebuke, she
      had urged him no more in words, but there was an entreaty in her eyes
      stronger than any spoken prayer, and a piteousness in the lingering of her
      hand in his harder to resist than ten thousand sad petitions. At last he
      had led her from the room and commended her to Helga&rsquo;s care. Then,
      returning to us, he stood silent a little while. We also were silent, Sapt
      sitting and looking up at him with his brows knit and his teeth restlessly
      chewing the moustache on his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, lad?&rdquo; he said at last, briefly putting the great question. Rudolf
      walked to the window and seemed to lose himself for a moment in the
      contemplation of the quiet night. There were no more than a few stragglers
      in the street now; the moon shone white and clear on the empty square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to walk up and down outside and think it over,&rdquo; he said,
      turning to us; and, as Bernenstein sprang up to accompany him, he added,
      &ldquo;No. Alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; said old Sapt, with a glance at the clock, whose hands were now
      hard on two o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;Take your time, lad, take your time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf looked at him and broke into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your dupe, old Sapt,&rdquo; said he, shaking his head. &ldquo;Trust me, if I
      decide to get away, I&rsquo;ll get away, be it what o&rsquo;clock it will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, confound you!&rdquo; grinned Colonel Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he left us, and then came that long time of scheming and planning, and
      most persistent eye-shutting, in which occupations an hour wore its life
      away. Rudolf had not passed out of the porch, and we supposed that he had
      betaken himself to the gardens, there to fight his battle. Old Sapt,
      having done his work, suddenly turned talkative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That moon there,&rdquo; he said, pointing his square, thick forefinger at the
      window, &ldquo;is a mighty untrustworthy lady. I&rsquo;ve known her wake a villain&rsquo;s
      conscience before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known her send a lover&rsquo;s to sleep,&rdquo; laughed young Bernenstein,
      rising from his table, stretching himself, and lighting a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, she&rsquo;s apt to take a man out of what he is,&rdquo; pursued old Sapt. &ldquo;Set a
      quiet man near her, and he dreams of battle; an ambitious fellow, after
      ten minutes of her, will ask nothing better than to muse all his life
      away. I don&rsquo;t trust her, Fritz; I wish the night were dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will she do to Rudolf Rassendyll?&rdquo; I asked, falling in with the old
      fellow&rsquo;s whimsical mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will see the queen&rsquo;s face in hers,&rdquo; cried Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may see God&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Sapt; and he shook himself as though an unwelcome
      thought had found its way to his mind and lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause fell on us, born of the colonel&rsquo;s last remark. We looked one
      another in the face. At last Sapt brought his hand down on the table with
      a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go back,&rdquo; he said sullenly, almost fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Bernenstein, drawing himself up. &ldquo;Nor you, Tarlenheim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I also go on,&rdquo; I answered. Then again there was a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may make a man soft as a sponge,&rdquo; reflected Sapt, starting again, &ldquo;or
      hard as a bar of steel. I should feel safer if the night were dark. I&rsquo;ve
      looked at her often from my tent and from bare ground, and I know her. She
      got me a decoration, and once she came near to making me turn tail. Have
      nothing to do with her, young Bernenstein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes for beauties nearer at hand,&rdquo; said Bernenstein, whose
      volatile temper soon threw off a serious mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chance for you, now Rupert of Hentzau&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Sapt
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke there was a knock at the door. When it opened James entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count of Luzau-Rischenheim begs to be allowed to speak with the
      king,&rdquo; said James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We expect his Majesty every moment. Beg the count to enter,&rdquo; Sapt
      answered; and, when Rischenheim came in, he went on, motioning the count
      to a chair: &ldquo;We are talking, my lord, of the influence of the moon on the
      careers of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do? What have you decided?&rdquo; burst out Rischenheim
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We decide nothing,&rdquo; answered Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what has Mr.&mdash;what has the king decided?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king decides nothing, my lord. She decides,&rdquo; and the old fellow
      pointed again through the window towards the moon. &ldquo;At this moment she
      makes or unmakes a king; but I can&rsquo;t tell you which. What of your cousin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that my cousin&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know that. What of him, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Rischenheim with some dignity, &ldquo;since he is dead, let him rest
      in peace. It is not for us to judge him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may well wish it were. For, by Heaven, I believe I should let the
      rogue off,&rdquo; said Colonel Sapt, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t think his Judge will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive him, I loved him,&rdquo; said Rischenheim. &ldquo;Yes, and many have
      loved him. His servants loved him, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend Bauer, for example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Bauer loved him. Where is Bauer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s gone to hell with his loved master,&rdquo; grunted Sapt, but he had
      the grace to lower his voice and shield his mouth with his hand, so that
      Rischenheim did not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where he is,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come,&rdquo; said Rischenheim, &ldquo;to put my services in all respects at the
      queen&rsquo;s disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at the king&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the king&rsquo;s? But the king is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore &lsquo;Long live the king!&rsquo;&rdquo; struck in young Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there should be a king&mdash;&rdquo; began Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do that?&rdquo; interrupted Rischenheim in breathless agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is deciding,&rdquo; said Colonel Sapt, and again he pointed to the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s a plaguey long time about it,&rdquo; remarked Lieutenant von
      Bernenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rischenheim sat silent for a moment. His face was pale, and when he spoke
      his voice trembled. But his words were resolute enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave my honor to the queen, and even in that I will serve her if she
      commands me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernenstein sprang forward and caught him by the hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I
      like,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and damn the moon, colonel!&rdquo; His sentence was hardly out
      of his mouth when the door opened, and to our astonishment the queen
      entered. Helga was just behind her; her clasped hands and frightened eyes
      seemed to protest that their coming was against her will. The queen was
      clad in a long white robe, and her hair hung on her shoulders, being but
      loosely bound with a ribbon. Her air showed great agitation, and without
      any greeting or notice of the rest she walked quickly across the room to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dream, Fritz,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It has come again. Helga persuaded me to
      lie down, and I was very tired, so at last I fell asleep. Then it came. I
      saw him, Fritz&mdash;I saw him as plainly as I see you. They all called
      him king, as they did to-day; but they did not cheer. They were quiet, and
      looked at him with sad faces. I could not hear what they said; they spoke
      in hushed voices. I heard nothing more than &lsquo;the king, the king,&rsquo; and he
      seemed to hear not even that. He lay still; he was lying on something,
      something covered with hanging stuff, I couldn&rsquo;t see what it was; yes,
      quite still. His face was so pale, and he didn&rsquo;t hear them say &lsquo;the king.&rsquo;
      Fritz, Fritz, he looked as if he were dead! Where is he? Where have you
      let him go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned from me and her eyes flashed over the rest. &ldquo;Where is he? Why
      aren&rsquo;t you with him?&rdquo; she demanded, with a sudden change of tone; &ldquo;why
      aren&rsquo;t you round him? You should be between him and danger, ready to give
      your lives for his. Indeed, gentlemen, you take your duty lightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It might be that there was little reason in her words. There appeared to
      be no danger threatening him, and after all he was not our king, much as
      we desired to make him such. Yet we did not think of any such matter. We
      were abashed before her reproof and took her indignation as deserved. We
      hung our heads, and Sapt&rsquo;s shame betrayed itself in the dogged sullenness
      of his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has chosen to go walking, madam, and to go alone. He ordered us&mdash;I
      say, he ordered us not to come. Surely we are right to obey him?&rdquo; The
      sarcastic inflection of his voice conveyed his opinion of the queen&rsquo;s
      extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obey him? Yes. You couldn&rsquo;t go with him if he forbade you. But you should
      follow him; you should keep him in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This much she spoke in proud tones and with a disdainful manner, but then
      came a sudden return to her former bearing. She held out her hands towards
      me, wailing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fritz, where is he? Is he safe? Find him for me, Fritz; find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find him for you if he&rsquo;s above ground, madam,&rdquo; I cried, for her
      appeal touched me to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no farther off than the gardens,&rdquo; grumbled old Sapt, still resentful
      of the queen&rsquo;s reproof and scornful of the woman&rsquo;s agitation. He was also
      out of temper with Rudolf himself, because the moon took so long in
      deciding whether she would make or unmake a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gardens!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Then let us look for him. Oh, you&rsquo;ve let him
      walk in the gardens alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should harm the fellow?&rdquo; muttered Sapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not hear him, for she had swept out of the room. Helga went with
      her, and we all followed, Sapt behind the rest of us, still very surly. I
      heard him grumbling away as we ran downstairs, and, having passed along
      the great corridor, came to the small saloon that opened on the gardens.
      There were no servants about, but we encountered a night-watchman, and
      Bernenstein snatched the lantern from the astonished man&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Save for the dim light thus furnished, the room was dark. But outside the
      windows the moon streamed brightly down on the broad gravel walk, on the
      formal flower-beds, and the great trees in the gardens. The queen made
      straight for the window. I followed her, and, having flung the window
      open, stood by her. The air was sweet, and the breeze struck with grateful
      coolness on my face. I saw that Sapt had come near and stood on the other
      side of the queen. My wife and the others were behind, looking out where
      our shoulders left space.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, in the bright moonlight, on the far side of the broad terrace,
      close by the line of tall trees that fringed its edge, we saw Rudolf
      Rassendyll pacing slowly up and down, with his hands behind his back and
      his eyes fixed on the arbiter of his fate, on her who was to make him a
      king or send him a fugitive from Strelsau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is, madam,&rdquo; said Sapt. &ldquo;Safe enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen did not answer. Sapt said no more, and of the rest of us none
      spoke. We stood watching him as he struggled with his great issue; a
      greater surely has seldom fallen to the lot of any man born in a private
      station. Yet I could read little of it on the face that the rays of white
      light displayed so clearly, although they turned his healthy tints to a
      dull gray, and gave unnatural sharpness to his features against the deep
      background of black foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard the queen&rsquo;s quick breathing, but there was scarcely another sound.
      I saw her clutch her gown and pull it away a little from her throat; save
      for that none in the group moved. The lantern&rsquo;s light was too dim to force
      notice from Mr. Rassendyll. Unconscious of our presence, he wrestled with
      fate that night in the gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the faintest exclamation came from Sapt. He put his hand back and
      beckoned to Bernenstein. The young man handed his lantern to the
      constable, who set it close to the side of the window-frame. The queen,
      absolutely engrossed in her lover, saw nothing, but I perceived what had
      caught Sapt&rsquo;s attention. There were scores on the paint and indentations
      in the wood, just at the edge of the panel and near the lock. I glanced at
      Sapt, who nodded his head. It looked very much as though somebody had
      tried to force the door that night, employing a knife which had dented the
      woodwork and scratched the paint. The least thing was enough to alarm us,
      standing where we stood, and the constable&rsquo;s face was full of suspicion.
      Who had sought an entrance? It could be no trained and practised
      housebreaker; he would have had better tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now our attention was again diverted. Rudolf stopped short. He still
      looked for a moment at the sky, then his glance dropped to the ground at
      his feet. A second later he jerked his head&mdash;it was bare, and I saw
      the dark red hair stir with the movement&mdash;like a man who has settled
      something which caused him a puzzle. In an instant we knew, by the quick
      intuition of contagious emotion, that the question had found its answer.
      He was by now king or a fugitive. The Lady of the Skies had given her
      decision. The thrill ran through us; I felt the queen draw herself
      together at my side; I felt the muscles of Rischenheim&rsquo;s arm which rested
      against my shoulder grow rigid and taut. Sapt&rsquo;s face was full of
      eagerness, and he gnawed his moustache silently. We gathered closer to one
      another. At last we could bear the suspense no longer. With one look at
      the queen and another at me, Sapt stepped on to the gravel. He would go
      and learn the answer; thus the unendurable strain that had stretched us
      like tortured men on a rack would be relieved. The queen did not answer
      his glance, nor even seem to see that he had moved. Her eyes were still
      all for Mr. Rassendyll, her thoughts buried in his; for her happiness was
      in his hands and lay poised on the issue of that decision whose
      momentousness held him for a moment motionless on the path. Often I seem
      to see him as he stood there, tall, straight, and stately, the king a
      man&rsquo;s fancy paints when he reads of great monarchs who flourished long ago
      in the springtime of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt&rsquo;s step crunched on the gravel. Rudolf heard it and turned his head.
      He saw Sapt, and he saw me also behind Sapt. He smiled composedly and
      brightly, but he did not move from where he was. He held out both hands
      towards the constable and caught him in their double grasp, still smiling
      down in his face. I was no nearer to reading his decision, though I saw
      that he had reached a resolution that was immovable and gave peace to his
      soul. If he meant to go on he would go on now, on to the end, without a
      backward look or a falter of his foot; if he had chosen the other way, he
      would depart without a murmur or a hesitation. The queen&rsquo;s quick breathing
      had ceased, she seemed like a statue; but Rischenheim moved impatiently,
      as though he could no longer endure the waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt&rsquo;s voice came harsh and grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Which is it to be&mdash;backward or forward?&rdquo; Rudolf
      pressed his hands and looked into his eyes. The answer asked but a word
      from him. The queen caught my arm; her rigid limbs seemed to give way, and
      she would have fallen if I had not supported her. At the same instant a
      man sprang out of the dark line of tall trees, directly behind Mr.
      Rassendyll. Bernenstein uttered a loud startled cry and rushed forward,
      pushing the queen herself violently out of his path. His hand flew to his
      side, and he ripped the heavy cavalry sword that belonged to his uniform
      of the Cuirassiers of the Guard from its sheath. I saw it flash in the
      moonlight, but its flash was quenched in a brighter short blaze. A shot
      rang out through the quiet gardens. Mr. Rassendyll did not loose his hold
      of Sapt&rsquo;s hands, but he sank slowly on to his knees. Sapt seemed
      paralyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Bernenstein cried out. It was a name this time. &ldquo;Bauer! By God,
      Bauer!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant he was across the path and by the trees. The assassin fired
      again, but now he missed. We saw the great sword flash high above
      Bernenstein&rsquo;s head and heard it whistle through the air. It crashed on the
      crown of Bauer&rsquo;s head, and he fell like a log to the ground with his skull
      split. The queen&rsquo;s hold on me relaxed; she sank into Rischenheim&rsquo;s arms. I
      ran forward and knelt by Mr. Rassendyll. He still held Sapt&rsquo;s hands, and
      by their help buoyed himself up. But when he saw me he let go of them and
      sank back against me, his head resting on my chest. He moved his lips, but
      seemed unable to speak. He was shot through the back. Bauer had avenged
      the master whom he loved, and was gone to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden stir from inside the palace. Shutters were flung back
      and windows thrown open. The group we made stood clean-cut, plainly
      visible in the moonlight. A moment later there was a rush of eager feet,
      and we were surrounded by officers and servants. Bernenstein stood by me
      now, leaning on his sword; Sapt had not uttered a word; his face was
      distorted with horror and bitterness. Rudolf&rsquo;s eyes were closed and his
      head lay back against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man has shot the king,&rdquo; said I, in bald, stupid explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once I found James, Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s servant, by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sent for doctors, my lord,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come, let us carry him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, Sapt and I lifted Rudolf and bore him across the gravel terrace and
      into the little saloon. We passed the queen. She was leaning on
      Rischenheim&rsquo;s arm, and held my wife&rsquo;s hand. We laid Rudolf down on a
      couch. Outside I heard Bernenstein say, &ldquo;Pick up that fellow and carry him
      somewhere out of sight.&rdquo; Then he also came in, followed by a crowd. He
      sent them all to the door, and we were left alone, waiting for the
      surgeon. The queen came up, Rischenheim still supporting her. &ldquo;Rudolf!
      Rudolf!&rdquo; she whispered, very softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his eyes, and his lips bent in a smile. She flung herself on her
      knees and kissed his hand passionately. &ldquo;The surgeon will be here
      directly,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolf&rsquo;s eyes had been on the queen. As I spoke he looked up at me, smiled
      again, and shook his head. I turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the surgeon came Sapt and I assisted him in his examination. The
      queen had been led away, and we were alone. The examination was very
      short. Then we carried Rudolf to a bed; the nearest chanced to be in
      Bernenstein&rsquo;s room; there we laid him, and there all that could be done
      for him was done. All this time we had asked no questions of the surgeon,
      and he had given no information. We knew too well to ask: we had all seen
      men die before now, and the look on the face was familiar to us. Two or
      three more doctors, the most eminent in Strelsau, came now, having been
      hastily summoned. It was their right to be called; but, for all the good
      they were, they might have been left to sleep the night out in their beds.
      They drew together in a little group at the end of the room and talked for
      a few minutes in low tones. James lifted his master&rsquo;s head and gave him a
      drink of water. Rudolf swallowed it with difficulty. Then I saw him feebly
      press James&rsquo;s hand, for the little man&rsquo;s face was full of sorrow. As his
      master smiled the servant mustered a smile in answer. I crossed over to
      the doctors. &ldquo;Well, gentlemen?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another, then the greatest of them said gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king may live an hour, Count Fritz. Should you not send for a
      priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went straight back to Rudolf Rassendyll. His eyes greeted me and
      questioned me. He was a man, and I played no silly tricks with him. I bent
      down and said: &ldquo;An hour, they think, Rudolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made one restless movement, whether of pain or protest I do not know.
      Then he spoke, very low, slowly, and with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they can go,&rdquo; he said; and when I spoke of a priest he shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to them and asked if anything more could be done. The answer
      was nothing; but I could not prevail further than to get all save one sent
      into an adjoining room; he who remained seated himself at a table some way
      off. Rudolf&rsquo;s eyes had closed again; old Sapt, who had not once spoken
      since the shot was fired, raised a haggard face to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better fetch her to him,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. I nodded my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sapt went while I stayed by him. Bernenstein came to him, bent down, and
      kissed his hand. The young fellow, who had borne himself with such
      reckless courage and dash throughout the affair, was quite unmanned now,
      and the tears were rolling down his face. I could have been much in the
      same plight, but I would not before Mr. Rassendyll. He smiled at
      Bernenstein. Then he said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she coming, Fritz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s coming, sire,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed the style of my address; a faint amused gleam shot into his
      languid eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for an hour, then,&rdquo; he murmured, and lay back on his pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came, dry-eyed, calm, and queenly. We all drew back, and she knelt
      down by his bed, holding his hand in her two hands. Presently the hand
      stirred; she let it go; then, knowing well what he wanted, she raised it
      herself and placed it on her head, while she bowed her face to the bed.
      His hand wandered for the last time over the gleaming hair that he had
      loved so well. She rose, passed her arm about his shoulders, and kissed
      his lips. Her face rested close to his, and he seemed to speak to her, but
      we could not have heard the words even if we would. So they remained for a
      long while.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came and felt his pulse, retreating afterwards with close-shut
      lips. We drew a little nearer, for we knew that he would not be long with
      us now. Suddenly strength seemed to come upon him. He raised himself in
      his bed, and spoke in distinct tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has decided,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to do the right thing through it
      all. Sapt, and Bernenstein, and you, old Fritz, shake my hand. No, don&rsquo;t
      kiss it. We&rsquo;ve done with pretence now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We shook his hand as he bade us. Then he took the queen&rsquo;s hand. Again she
      knew his mind, and moved it to his lips. &ldquo;In life and in death, my sweet
      queen,&rdquo; he murmured. And thus he fell asleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THE COMING OF THE DREAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      THERE IS little need, and I have little heart, to dwell on what followed
      the death of Mr. Rassendyll. The plans we had laid to secure his tenure of
      the throne, in case he had accepted it, served well in the event of his
      death. Bauer&rsquo;s lips were for ever sealed; the old woman was too scared and
      appalled to hint even to her gossips of the suspicions she entertained.
      Rischenheim was loyal to the pledge he had given to the queen. The ashes
      of the hunting-lodge held their secret fast, and none suspected when the
      charred body which was called Rudolf Rassendyll&rsquo;s was laid to quiet rest
      in the graveyard of the town of Zenda, hard by the tomb of Herbert the
      forester. For we had from the first rejected any idea of bringing the
      king&rsquo;s body to Strelsau and setting it in the place of Mr. Rassendyll&rsquo;s.
      The difficulties of such an undertaking were almost insuperable; in our
      hearts we did not desire to conquer them. As a king Rudolf Rassendyll had
      died, as a king let him lie. As a king he lay in his palace at Strelsau,
      while the news of his murder at the hands of a confederate of Rupert of
      Hentzau went forth to startle and appall the world. At a mighty price our
      task had been made easy; many might have doubted the living, none
      questioned the dead; suspicions which might have gathered round a throne
      died away at the gate of a vault. The king was dead. Who would ask if it
      were in truth the king who lay in state in the great hall of the palace,
      or whether the humble grave at Zenda held the bones of the last male
      Elphberg? In the silence of the grave all murmurs and questionings were
      hushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the day people had been passing and repassing through the great
      hall. There, on a stately bier surmounted by a crown and the drooping
      folds of the royal banner, lay Rudolf Rassendyll. The highest officer
      guarded him; in the cathedral the archbishop said a mass for his soul. He
      had lain there three days; the evening of the third had come, and early on
      the morrow he was to be buried. There is a little gallery in the hall,
      that looks down on the spot where the bier stood; here was I on this
      evening, and with me Queen Flavia. We were alone together, and together we
      saw beneath us the calm face of the dead man. He was clad in the white
      uniform in which he had been crowned; the ribbon of the Red Rose was
      across his breast. His hand held a true red rose, fresh and fragrant;
      Flavia herself had set it there, that even in death he might not miss the
      chosen token of her love. I had not spoken to her, nor she to me, since we
      came there. We watched the pomp round him, and the circles of people that
      came to bring a wreath for him or to look upon his face. I saw a girl come
      and kneel long at the bier&rsquo;s foot. She rose and went away sobbing, leaving
      a little circlet of flowers. It was Rosa Holf. I saw women come and go
      weeping, and men bite their lips as they passed by. Rischenheim came,
      pale-faced and troubled; and while all came and went, there, immovable,
      with drawn sword, in military stiffness, old Sapt stood at the head of the
      bier, his eyes set steadily in front of him, and his body never stirring
      from hour to hour through the long day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A distant faint hum of voices reached us. The queen laid her hand on my
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the dream, Fritz,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hark! They speak of the king; they
      speak in low voices and with grief, but they call him king. It&rsquo;s what I
      saw in the dream. But he does not hear nor heed. No, he can&rsquo;t hear nor
      heed even when I call him my king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden impulse came on me, and I turned to her, asking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had he decided, madam? Would he have been king?&rdquo; She started a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t think of it while he
      spoke to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what then did he speak, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only of his love&mdash;of nothing but his love, Fritz,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I take it that when a man comes to die, love is more to him than a
      kingdom: it may be, if we could see truly, that it is more to him even
      while he lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of nothing but his great love for me, Fritz,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;And my
      love brought him to his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have had it otherwise,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered; and she leant over the parapet of the gallery,
      stretching out her arms to him. But he lay still and quiet, not hearing
      and not heeding what she murmured, &ldquo;My king! my king!&rdquo; It was even as it
      had been in the dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night James, the servant, took leave of his dead master and of us. He
      carried to England by word of mouth&mdash;for we dared write nothing down&mdash;the
      truth concerning the King of Ruritania and Mr. Rassendyll. It was to be
      told to the Earl of Burlesdon, Rudolf&rsquo;s brother, under a pledge of
      secrecy; and to this day the earl is the only man besides ourselves who
      knows the story. His errand done, James returned in order to enter the
      queen&rsquo;s service, in which he still is; and he told us that when Lord
      Burlesdon had heard the story he sat silent for a great while, and then
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did well. Some day I will visit his grave. Tell her Majesty that there
      is still a Rassendyll, if she has need of one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The offer was such as should come from a man of Rudolf&rsquo;s name, yet I trust
      that the queen needs no further service than such as it is our humble duty
      and dear delight to render her. It is our part to strive to lighten the
      burden that she bears, and by our love to assuage her undying grief. For
      she reigns now in Ruritania alone, the last of all the Elphbergs; and her
      only joy is to talk of Mr. Rassendyll with those few who knew him, her
      only hope that she may some day be with him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In great pomp we laid him to his rest in the vault of the kings of
      Ruritania in the Cathedral of Strelsau. There he lies among the princes of
      the House of Elphberg. I think that if there be indeed any consciousness
      among the dead, or any knowledge of what passes in the world they have
      left, they should be proud to call him brother. There rises in memory of
      him a stately monument, and people point it out to one another as the
      memorial of King Rudolf. I go often to the spot, and recall in thought all
      that passed when he came the first time to Zenda, and again on his second
      coming. For I mourn him as a man mourns a trusted leader and a loved
      comrade, and I should have asked no better than to be allowed to serve him
      all my days. Yet I serve the queen, and in that I do most truly serve her
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Times change for all of us. The roaring flood of youth goes by, and the
      stream of life sinks to a quiet flow. Sapt is an old man now; soon my sons
      will be grown up, men enough themselves to serve Queen Flavia. Yet the
      memory of Rudolf Rassendyll is fresh to me as on the day he died, and the
      vision of the death of Rupert of Hentzau dances often before my eyes. It
      may be that some day the whole story shall be told, and men shall judge of
      it for themselves. To me it seems now as though all had ended well. I must
      not be misunderstood: my heart is still sore for the loss of him. But we
      saved the queen&rsquo;s fair fame, and to Rudolf himself the fatal stroke came
      as a relief from a choice too difficult: on the one side lay what impaired
      his own honor, on the other what threatened hers. As I think on this my
      anger at his death is less, though my grief cannot be. To this day I know
      not how he chose; no, and I don&rsquo;t know how he should have chosen. Yet he
      had chosen, for his face was calm and clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come, I have thought so much of him that I will go now and stand before
      his monument, taking with me my last-born son, a little lad of ten. He is
      not too young to desire to serve the queen, and not too young to learn to
      love and reverence him who sleeps there in the vault and was in his life
      the noblest gentleman I have known.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will take the boy with me and tell him what I may of brave King Rudolf,
      how he fought and how he loved, and how he held the queen&rsquo;s honor and his
      own above all things in this world. The boy is not too young to learn such
      lessons from the life of Mr. Rassendyll. And while we stand there I will
      turn again into his native tongue&mdash;for, alas, the young rogue loves
      his toy soldiers better than his Latin!&mdash;the inscription that the
      queen wrote with her own hand, directing that it should be inscribed in
      that stately tongue over the tomb in which her life lies buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Rudolf, who reigned lately in this city, and reigns for ever in her
      heart.&mdash;QUEEN FLAVIA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him the meaning, and he spelt the big words over in his childish
      voice; at first he stumbled, but the second time he had it right, and
      recited with a little touch of awe in his fresh young tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      RUDOLFO
    </p>
    <p>
      Qui in hac civitate nuper regnavit In corde ipsius in aeternum regnat
    </p>
    <p>
      FLAVIA REGINA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt his hand tremble in mine, and he looked up in my face. &ldquo;God save
      the Queen, father,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
